# 🔥 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED  
**Next Phase:** 🚀 RAPID MULTI-SPRINT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVATED

---

## ✅ **CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED**

### 1️⃣ **Port Configuration Alignment** ✅
**Problem:** Documentation showed wrong ports for services  
**Solution:** Updated all documentation to match code reality

| Service | Documented Port | Actual Port | Status |
|---------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| Memory Gateway | 8800 | 9696 | ✅ Fixed |
| Jobs Service | 8003 | 8000 | ✅ Fixed |
| Task Capsule Repo | 8910 | 8005 | ✅ Fixed |
| Orchestrator | 8100 | 8002 | ✅ Fixed |

**Files Updated:**
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/development/Developer_Setup.md`  
- `docs/SomaGent_Architecture.md`

### 2️⃣ **Kubernetes Deployment Fixed** ✅
**Problem:** Helm chart used placeholder nginx:alpine images  
**Solution:** Real service images configured with health probes

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `k8s/helm/soma-agent/values.yaml` with proper GHCR images
- Added liveness/readiness probes to `templates/deployment.yaml`
- Configured proper health check endpoints (`/health`)

### 3️⃣ **Marketplace Service Transition** ✅
**Problem:** Documentation referenced removed marketplace service  
**Solution:** Properly documented Task Capsule Repository replacement

**Updates:**
- Removed all references to defunct marketplace service
- Documented Task Capsule Repository with actual endpoints
- Updated service descriptions across all documentation

### 4️⃣ **Build & Deploy Automation** ✅
**Problem:** No automated way to build/deploy services  
**Solution:** Complete automation scripts created

**Scripts Created:**
- `scripts/build_and_push.sh` - Docker image building and registry push
- `scripts/dev-deploy.sh` - Quick development deployment
- `scripts/integration-test.sh` - Service validation testing  
- `scripts/rapid-sprint.sh` - Multi-sprint parallel execution

### 5️⃣ **CI Pipeline Enhancement** ✅
**Problem:** CI didn't build images or test Helm deployments  
**Solution:** Enhanced CI with image builds and Helm testing

**CI Improvements:**
- Added Docker image building on main branch
- Integrated Kind cluster setup for testing
- Added Helm chart deployment validation
- Configured automated testing pipeline

### 6️⃣ **Documentation Synchronization** ✅
**Problem:** Massive documentation debt vs code reality  
**Solution:** Core documentation aligned with implementation

**Documentation Updates:**
- Service architecture aligned with actual code
- API endpoints match implemented functionality
- Deployment instructions reflect current setup
- Developer setup guides corrected

---

## 🚀 **RAPID DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE**

### **Canonical Roadmap Created** 📋
- New authoritative roadmap: `docs/CANONICAL_ROADMAP.md`
- Multi-sprint wave approach for maximum velocity
- Clear milestones and success metrics defined
- Big brain unlimited capacity mode activated

### **Automated Development Pipeline** ⚙️
```bash
# One-command deployment from scratch
./scripts/rapid-sprint.sh
