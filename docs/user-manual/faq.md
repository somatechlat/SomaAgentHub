## üöÄ Getting Started

### Q: What is SomaAgentHub and how does it work?

**A:** SomaAgentHub is an enterprise-grade platform for orchestrating multiple AI agents to work together on complex tasks. Instead of using a single AI system, you can coordinate specialized agents that excel in specific domains (document analysis, code generation, data processing, etc.) to create sophisticated workflows.

**Key Components:**
- **Gateway API** - Entry point for all interactions
- **Orchestrator** - Coordinates agent workflows using Temporal
- **Policy Engine** - Ensures compliance and governance
- **Memory Gateway** - Provides persistent context and knowledge
- **Identity Service** - Manages authentication and authorization
