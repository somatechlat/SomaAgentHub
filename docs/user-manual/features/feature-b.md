# Intelligent Memory System

**Semantic memory and context management for AI agents**

The Intelligent Memory System is SomaAgentHub's advanced memory architecture that enables agents to store, recall, and share information intelligently. Unlike simple databases, this system uses semantic understanding to find relevant context and maintain coherent conversations across long time periods.

---

## üéØ What is Intelligent Memory?

The Intelligent Memory System provides:

- **Semantic Search** - Find information by meaning, not just keywords
- **Persistent Context** - Maintain conversation state across sessions  
- **Cross-Agent Sharing** - Allow multiple agents to access shared memories
- **Automatic Organization** - Intelligent categorization and relationship mapping
- **Privacy Controls** - User-specific and tenant-specific memory isolation

### How It Works
Instead of storing raw text, the system creates **semantic embeddings** that capture meaning. When agents need information, they search by context and relevance rather than exact matches.

**Example**: An agent searching for "budget constraints" would find memories about "financial limitations," "spending restrictions," and "cost considerations" even if those exact words weren't used.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Store Information in Memory

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8004/v1/memories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer demo-token" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user123",
    "content": "The Q4 marketing campaign should focus on sustainability messaging, targeting millennials and Gen Z customers who prioritize environmental responsibility.",
    "memory_type": "project_context",
    "metadata": {
      "project": "Q4_marketing_campaign", 
      "department": "marketing",
      "priority": "high",
      "created_by": "sarah.johnson",
      "tags": ["sustainability", "marketing", "target-audience"]
    }
  }'
```

### 2. Recall Relevant Information

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8004/v1/recall \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer demo-token" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What are our marketing priorities for environmental messaging?",
    "user_id": "user123",
    "limit": 5,
    "similarity_threshold": 0.7,
    "filters": {
      "memory_type": ["project_context", "strategic_decisions"],
      "department": "marketing"
    }
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "memories": [
    {
      "id": "mem_abc123",
      "content": "The Q4 marketing campaign should focus on sustainability messaging...",
      "similarity_score": 0.92,
      "metadata": {
        "project": "Q4_marketing_campaign",
        "created_at": "2024-01-10T14:30:00Z",
        "tags": ["sustainability", "marketing"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "query_embedding": [...],
  "search_stats": {
    "total_searched": 1247,
    "results_returned": 1,
    "search_time_ms": 45
  }
}
```

### 3. Use Memory in Agent Conversations

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer demo-token" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Create a social media strategy for our sustainability campaign"
      }
    ],
    "memory_config": {
      "use_memory": true,
      "memory_context_limit": 10,
      "relevance_threshold": 0.75
    },
    "user_id": "user123"
  }'
```

The agent will automatically retrieve relevant memories and incorporate them into the response.

## üõ†Ô∏è Memory Types & Organization

### Memory Categories

| Type | Purpose | Retention | Access Pattern |
|------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| `conversation_history` | Chat and dialogue context | Session-based | Sequential access |
| `project_context` | Project-specific information | Project lifecycle | Contextual search |

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Memory Not Found**
```bash
# Check if memory was stored correctly
curl http://localhost:8004/v1/memories/MEMORY_ID

# Verify user permissions
curl http://localhost:8004/v1/memories?user_id=USER_ID&limit=10
```

**2. Poor Search Results**
```bash
# Check embedding quality
curl -X POST http://localhost:8004/v1/debug/similarity \
  -d '{"text1": "your query", "text2": "expected result"}'

# Adjust similarity threshold
curl -X POST http://localhost:8004/v1/recall \
  -d '{"query": "...", "similarity_threshold": 0.6}'
```

**3. Memory System Performance**
```bash
# Check vector database health
curl http://localhost:8004/v1/health/detailed

# Monitor search performance
curl http://localhost:8004/v1/metrics | grep search_duration
```

### Best Practices

1. **Meaningful Content** - Store substantial, contextual information rather than fragments
2. **Good Metadata** - Use rich metadata for better filtering and organization
3. **Regular Cleanup** - Implement lifecycle policies to manage memory growth
4. **Monitor Usage** - Track search patterns and memory effectiveness
5. **Privacy Awareness** - Be mindful of sensitive information storage and access
