### Workflow Types

**Linear Workflows:**
- Simple sequential processes
- Each step depends on the previous
- Clear start and end points
- Example: Document approval process

**Branching Workflows:**
- Conditional logic and decision points
- Multiple possible execution paths
- Dynamic routing based on data
- Example: Customer support escalation

**Parallel Workflows:**
- Multiple concurrent execution paths
- Synchronization points for coordination
- Improved performance through parallelism
- Example: Multi-team project delivery

**Event-Driven Workflows:**
- Triggered by external events
- Reactive processing patterns
- Integration with external systems
- Example: Order processing pipeline

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Create Your First Workflow

**Using the Visual Designer:**

1. **Navigate to Workflows** in the main menu
2. **Click "Create New Workflow"**
3. **Choose "Visual Designer"**
4. **Drag components** from the palette:
   - **Start Node** - Workflow entry point
   - **Agent Task** - Automated processing step
   - **Human Task** - Manual approval or input
   - **Decision Node** - Conditional branching
   - **End Node** - Workflow completion

**Example: Document Review Workflow**
```
[Start] → [Document Upload] → [AI Analysis] → [Human Review] → [Approval Decision]
                                                     ↓
                                              [Approved] → [Publish]
                                                     ↓
                                              [Rejected] → [Return for Revision]
```

### 2. Configure Workflow Steps

**Agent Task Configuration:**
```yaml
step:
  name: "document-analysis"
  type: "agent-task"
  agent: "document-analyzer"
  parameters:
    analysis_type: "comprehensive"
    output_format: "structured"
  timeout: "300s"
  retry_policy:
    max_attempts: 3
    backoff: "exponential"
```

**Human Task Configuration:**
```yaml
step:
  name: "manager-approval"
  type: "human-task"
  assignee: "role:manager"
  form:
    title: "Document Approval Required"
    fields:
      - name: "decision"
        type: "radio"
        options: ["approve", "reject", "request_changes"]
      - name: "comments"
        type: "textarea"
        required: false
  timeout: "24h"
  escalation:
    after: "4h"
    to: "role:senior_manager"
```

### 3. Deploy and Execute

**Deploy Workflow:**
```bash
# Using CLI
soma workflow deploy document-review.yaml

# Using Web Interface
# 1. Click "Deploy" in the workflow designer
# 2. Select target environment
# 3. Configure deployment parameters
```

**Start Workflow Instance:**
```bash

## 🎛️ Advanced Workflow Patterns

### 1. Conditional Branching

**Business Rule Engine Integration:**
```yaml
decision_node:
  name: "risk-assessment"
  type: "conditional"
  conditions:
    - condition: "risk_score > 0.8"
      next_step: "high-risk-review"
    - condition: "risk_score > 0.5"
      next_step: "standard-review"
    - condition: "risk_score <= 0.5"
      next_step: "auto-approve"
  default: "manual-review"
```

### 2. Parallel Execution with Synchronization

**Fan-out/Fan-in Pattern:**
```yaml
parallel_section:
  name: "multi-team-review"
  type: "parallel"
  branches:
    - name: "legal-review"
      steps: ["legal-analysis", "compliance-check"]
    - name: "technical-review"
      steps: ["code-review", "security-scan"]
    - name: "business-review"
      steps: ["requirements-check", "stakeholder-approval"]
  synchronization:
    type: "wait-for-all"
    timeout: "48h"
    on_timeout: "escalate-to-manager"
```

### 3. Loop and Iteration

**Retry with Feedback Loop:**
```yaml
loop_section:
  name: "quality-improvement"
  type: "loop"
  condition: "quality_score < 0.9"
  max_iterations: 3
  steps:
    - name: "quality-check"
      agent: "quality-analyzer"
    - name: "improvement-suggestions"
      agent: "improvement-advisor"
    - name: "apply-improvements"
      type: "human-task"
      assignee: "role:developer"
```

### 4. Event-Driven Workflows

**External Event Integration:**
```yaml
event_trigger:
  name: "order-processing"
  type: "event-driven"
  triggers:
    - event: "order.created"
      source: "ecommerce-system"
    - event: "payment.confirmed"
      source: "payment-gateway"
  workflow:
    steps:
      - name: "validate-order"
      - name: "check-inventory"
      - name: "process-payment"
      - name: "fulfill-order"
```
