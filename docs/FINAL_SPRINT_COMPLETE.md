⚠️ WE DO NOT MOCK, IMITATE, OR SIGN OFF ON WORK THAT IS NOT REAL. THE NOTES BELOW REFLECT THE ACTUAL STATE AS OF OCTOBER 8, 2025.

# Final Sprint Status — Reality Check (October 8, 2025)

## Executive Summary

- **Multi-agent integration:** AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph, and A2A adapters plus `FrameworkRouter`/`UnifiedMultiAgentWorkflow` are implemented. No automated tests, telemetry, or benchmarks exist.
- **Observability, marketplace, MinIO, Grafana/Prometheus work:** Not started. Files referenced in earlier reports (`minio_client.py`, marketplace endpoints, Grafana dashboards, Prometheus alerts) do not exist in the repository.
- **Microservice coverage:** Several services exist in the repo, but many touted endpoints/dashboards/alerts remain aspirational. Production readiness tasks (runbooks, CI guardrails, alerts) are outstanding.
- **Risk:** Documentation previously claimed 100% completion across infrastructure, services, and observability. Actual delivery covers only the multi-agent adapter work.

## What Is Done

| Area | Reality | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Multi-agent adapters | ✅ Implemented | AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph, A2A activities live under `services/orchestrator/app/integrations/`. |
| Framework routing | ✅ Implemented | `FrameworkRouter` + `UnifiedMultiAgentWorkflow` route to implemented adapters; returns `activity`/`pattern`. |
| Documentation sync | ✅ In progress | Core integration docs updated (`INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SPRINT0_FRAMEWORK_PLAN.md`). |
| Repo structure | ✅ Present | Services, infra, docs directories exist; content varies in completeness. |

## What Is Not Done

- MinIO client module, marketplace CRUD endpoints, Grafana dashboards, Prometheus alert rules referenced previously.
- Observability stack (Langfuse/OpenLLMetry/Giskard) and related Helm charts.
- Automated testing, benchmarking, load testing, or performance validation for adapters.
- Production readiness checklist: runbooks, alerts, DR procedures, CI guardrails.
- SDK/CLI alignment with `/v1/sessions` and `/v1/mao` APIs.

## Honest Status Checklist

- [x] Multi-agent adapters integrated with Temporal.
- [x] Unified multi-agent workflow dispatching to adapters.
- [ ] Observability Track A deliverables (Langfuse, tracing, nightly evaluations).
- [ ] Marketplace API, MinIO integration, Grafana dashboards, Prometheus alerts.
- [ ] Automated tests, benchmarks, and load/perf validation.
- [ ] Runbooks, alerting, and production operations work.

## Next Steps Before Claiming Completion

1. Finish adapter QA: unit/integration tests, retry/backoff strategies, telemetry hooks.
2. Re-scope observability, marketplace, and infrastructure sprints with realistic estimates.
3. Remove or clearly label any documentation that still implies completed work (dashboards, alerts, services) until implemented.
4. Align SDKs, CLI, and samples with the new session/MAO endpoints.
5. Prepare a credible production readiness plan covering monitoring, DR, load testing, and operational playbooks.
