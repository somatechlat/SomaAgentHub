# SomaGent Security & Moderation Playbook

## 1. Objectives
- Preserve integrity of SomaGent instances against abuse, prompt injection, and malicious tool usage.
- Enforce SomaBrain’s constitution (do-no-harm, honesty) at every interaction.
- Provide transparent auditing and rapid incident response.
- Offer configurable guardrails for both managed and self-hosted deployments.

---

## 2. Identity & Access
- **Strong Authentication**: Support OIDC/SAML with MFA for privileged users. Guest sessions limited in scope/time.
- **Capability Claims**: JWTs embed fine-grained capabilities (`training:manage`, `capsule:publish`, `tool:configure`). Gateway denies actions without required claims.
- **Session Monitoring**: Invalidate idle tokens quickly; detect anomalous IP/device usage via heuristics or optional threat feeds.

---

## 3. Moderation & Behavioral Guardrails
### 3.1 Request Moderation
- All inputs (users, external systems) pass through a moderation filter before the orchestrator.
- Rule engine + ML classifiers tag requests with categories (hate, violence, fraud, self-harm, etc.) and severity.
- Configurable moderation providers: internal (SomaBrain policy models) or external APIs (OpenAI moderation, HuggingFace models).

### 3.2 Constitution Enforcement
- Policy Engine refuses requests violating the constitution. Refusals cite the relevant clause and log the attempt.
- Capsules inherit guardrails automatically; persona prompts emphasize compliance.

### 3.3 Strike Tracking & Lockouts
- Maintain per-user/tenant counters in Redis/Postgres:
  - 1st offense: gentle warning + education.
  - 2nd offense: escalate warning, notify admins.
  - 3rd offense (within sliding window): lock session/tenant, require manual review.
- Events published to Kafka (`compliance.audit`).

### 3.4 Alerts & Dashboards
- Managed UI shows real-time moderation alerts; severity-based notifications via Slack/PagerDuty.
- Weekly reports summarize attempts, categories, and outcomes.
- Provide APIs for SIEM integration (Splunk/Elastic).

---

## 4. Tool & Adapter Security
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Run adapters in isolated containers/microVMs. Limit network, filesystem, CPU per job.
- **Adapter Registry**: Allow only vetted adapters. New adapters require code scanning and policy simulations before enabling.
- **API Constraints**: Enforce rate limits, request signing, and health checks for external APIs. Credential leaks trigger immediate revocation.
- **UI Automation**: Playwright-based automations run in hardened environments, with DOM snapshots redacted before storage.

---

## 5. Data Protection
- Postgres encrypted at rest (AES, KMS-managed keys), Redis TLS enabled, S3/GCS with bucket policies.
- Secrets stored in Vault/KMS; agents access via short-lived tokens. No secrets in logs.
- Automatic masking for sensitive outputs (e.g., store placeholders instead of raw passwords in transcripts).

---

## 6. Observability & Incident Response
- **Audit Trails**:
  - Constitution updates, capsule installs, tool executions, training sessions.
  - Moderation refusals with reason codes.
- **Metrics**: Moderation hit rate, policy violations, training lock creation, token spend. Exposed via Prometheus.
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry spans include capsule ID, persona, moderation results.
- **Resilience Metrics**: Monitor Kafka/Postgres replication lag, Redis backlog depth, SomaBrain sync freshness, and consumer checkpoint age; alert when thresholds approach RPO budgets.
- **Outage Playbooks**: Maintain tested runbooks for message replay, memory rebalance, cache rebuild, and regional failover; run quarterly chaos drills to validate steps.
- **Incident Playbooks**: Document escalation paths for repeated abuse, adapter compromise, or token exhaustion. Store in `docs/runbooks/`. See `docs/runbooks/security.md` for mTLS and secret procedures.

---

## 7. Network & Platform Security
- Enforce mTLS with SPIFFE/SPIRE IDs between all services.
- Apply Kubernetes network policies (deny-all baseline).
- Place Gateway behind WAF/CDN (Cloudflare, AWS WAF) with DDoS mitigation and request filtering.
- Container hardening: minimal base images, vulnerability scanning (Snyk/Trivy), runtime monitoring (Falco).

---

## 8. Governance Workflows
- Multi-party approval for constitution changes, marketplace capsule publication, tool installs in managed tenants.
- Constitution updates originate only from root operators (us). The document stays in SomaBrain; downstream services cache only signed hashes and refuse to operate if validation fails.
- Emergency “kill switches” (CLI/UI) to disable capsules/personas or pause new requests for a tenant.
- Token budget enforcement: estimator + throttle prevent cost overruns or abuse.

---

## 9. Testing & Validation
- Red-team simulations (prompt injection, privilege escalation, tool abuse) on each release.
- Chaos testing: service outages, network partitions, moderation service down (ensure safe fallback).
- Regular pen-tests; integrate results into backlog.

---

## 10. Compliance & Transparency
- SOC 2/ISO 27001-ready: change management logs, access reviews, encrypted backups, incident reports.
- Data residency controls per tenant (region-specific deployments).
- Publish transparency reports for managed service (summary of moderated requests, security updates).

---

## 11. Self-Hosted Guidance
- Provide default constitution + moderation configs, but highlight operator responsibility.
- Supply templates for API keys, secrets rotation, and compliance settings.
- Encourage adoption of the same guardrails even in community deployments (opt-in modules).

---

By layering moderation filters, constitutional enforcement, strike tracking, sandboxed tools, and exhaustive observability, SomaGent remains safe and trustworthy—even at internet scale. This playbook should be revisited periodically as new threats emerge.
