# SomaGent Default Terms of Use (Draft)

> **Notice**: This document is a working draft for internal use. It is not legal advice. A licensed attorney must review and adapt these terms before distribution to users.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
- By creating an account, accessing, or using SomaGent (including web, mobile, CLI, IDE, or API clients), the customer (“Tenant”) and their authorized users agree to these Terms.
- If the Tenant does not agree, they must not access SomaGent. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
- The individual accepting the Terms represents that they have authority to bind the Tenant.

## 2. Definitions
- **SomaGent**: The multi-tenant agent platform, including all services, APIs, SDKs, clients, and documentation.
- **Tenant Data**: Information uploaded or generated by Tenant or its users, including prompts, files, knowledge snapshots, audio, logs, and outputs.
- **Derived Data**: Insights produced by SomaGent from Tenant Data (e.g., embeddings, metrics, model tuning) that do not reveal raw Tenant Data.
- **Constitution**: Governance ruleset enforced by SomaBrain and related services.
- **Marketplace Content**: Personas, Task Capsules, tool adapters, or assets obtained via the marketplace.

## 3. License & Access
- SomaGent grants Tenant a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the platform for Tenant’s internal business purposes, subject to these Terms.
- Tenant authorizes SomaGent to host, process, transmit, and display Tenant Data solely to provide and improve SomaGent.
- SomaGent may suspend access if Tenant violates policies, exceeds agreed usage limits, or jeopardizes platform security.

## 4. Tenant Responsibilities
- Maintain accurate account information and safeguard credentials.
- Ensure users comply with the Constitution, Acceptable Use Policy, and third-party tool terms.
- Obtain and document consent from individuals whose personal data is uploaded (including audio/voice data).
- Configure budgets, deployment modes, and tool scopes consistent with Tenant’s legal obligations.

## 5. Data Usage & Ownership
- Tenant retains ownership of Tenant Data. SomaGent retains ownership of software, Derived Data, and platform improvements.
- SomaGent may produce Derived Data (e.g., embeddings, telemetry, model performance statistics) to operate, secure, and enhance the platform. Derived Data may be used to train system models provided it is anonymized and aggregated.
- Marketplace Content may include third-party licenses; Tenant must adhere to associated terms.
- SomaGent will delete Tenant Data within 60 days of termination unless required by law or subject to ongoing obligations.

## 6. Privacy & Security
- SomaGent will implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards (encryption in transit/at rest, access controls, audit logging, redundancy) consistent with industry standards.
- Incident Response: SomaGent will notify Tenant of unauthorized access or data breaches without undue delay, including remediation details.
- Tenants may request audit logs, data exports, or deletion consistent with Privacy Laws (GDPR/CPRA) using documented procedures.

## 7. Acceptable Use
- Tenant will not use SomaGent to violate law, infringe rights, generate malicious content, spam, or bypass security controls.
- Prohibited uses include: weaponization, exploitation of minors, discrimination, harassment, disinformation, or unauthorized surveillance.
- SomaGent reserves the right to remove offending content, suspend accounts, or limit functionality to enforce moderation policies.

## 8. Tool Integrations & Third Parties
- SomaGent may integrate with third-party APIs. Tenant authorizes SomaGent to access those services using Tenant-provided credentials.
- Tenant remains responsible for third-party terms and consents. SomaGent is not liable for actions or outages of third-party services.
- Marketplace Content provided by third parties is offered “as is”. SomaGent may review or remove content deemed unsafe or non-compliant.

## 9. Audio & Voice Features
- Tenant must notify and obtain consent from participants before recording or transcribing audio.
- Voice prints or biometric identifiers are optional features; Tenant is responsible for determining legality in their jurisdiction.
- Audio data may be processed to create embeddings or energy metrics; raw audio is retained only as necessary for processing or debugging.

## 10. Training & Improvement
- In “Training Mode”, tenant interactions may be used to refine persona packages, tool heuristics, or model prompts for Tenant’s benefit.
- SomaGent may use aggregated, anonymized data to improve global platform capabilities unless Tenant opts out via contract.
- Tenants may disable training for sensitive personas; doing so may limit certain features.

## 11. Payment & Usage Limits
- Fees, usage tiers, and overage rates are defined in the service order. SomaGent may throttle or suspend access if fees are overdue or usage materially exceeds limits.
- Token estimator forecasts are informational; Tenant remains responsible for actual usage charges.

## 12. Disclaimers
- SOMAGENT IS PROVIDED “AS IS.” SomaGent disclaims all warranties (express or implied) including merchantability, fitness, and non-infringement.
- Outputs generated by agents may contain errors or biases. Tenant must review critical outputs, especially for legal, medical, financial, or safety-sensitive tasks.

## 13. Limitation of Liability
- SomaGent’s aggregate liability under these Terms will not exceed fees paid by Tenant in the 12 months preceding the claim.

- Upon termination, SomaGent will disable access, delete Tenant Data per retention commitments, and provide reasonable assistance with data exports for 30 days.

## 16. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

- Parties agree to attempt informal resolution before filing claims.

## 17. Changes to Terms

- Material changes affecting privacy or data ownership require explicit acceptance.

## 18. Miscellaneous
