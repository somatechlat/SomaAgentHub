# SomaGent – Canonical Development Roadmap

## Product One‑Pager (Integrated)

**Customer**: Teams deploying AI agents into production environments.

**Job**: Safely orchestrate agent teams, keep latency predictable, and bill by usage.

**Why now**: AI agents are graduating from demos to production workloads; organizations need a real control‑plane that provides safety, observability, and cost control.

**Key Features**
- **Signed bundles & admission policies** – cryptographic signing (cosign), SBOM, and policy evaluation before any agent runs.
- **Zero‑trust mTLS everywhere** – SPIRE/SPIRE SVIDs for inter‑service auth.
- **Memory with provenance (SomaBrain)** – recall latency ≤ 120 ms, full audit trail for each retrieved fact.
- **Temporal‑powered team orchestration** – capsules & DAGs enable multi‑agent workflows.
- **Tool Broker** – JSON‑schema validated, sandboxed tool execution with streaming events.
- **Metering → invoices** – token, tool‑call, job‑minute, storage, egress usage tracked per‑tenant; marketplace pricing model.

**Pricing (example)**
- Platform fee (fixed monthly per‑tenant).
- Usage SKUs: tokens, tool calls, job‑minutes, storage, egress.

**Proof**
- Synthetic baseline (see `/benchmarks`) meets latency targets.
- Acceptance tests (`/benchmarks/…` and `14_E2E…`) enforce the targets.

## Roadmap Overview (Phases A‑D) – Detailed Integration of the One‑Pager

| Phase | Duration | Core Deliverables | Alignment with Product One‑Pager |
|------|----------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| **A – Spine** | 2–4 weeks | Edge API, Core orchestration, Memory‑Recall service, Event streaming, Dashboards | Provides the **Edge API** (gateway) and **Memory with provenance** (≤ 120 ms recall) – the foundation for safe orchestration and observability. |
| **B – Durable & Safe** | 3–5 weeks | Temporal job engine, Remember service, Admission (constitution) service, Billing ledger | Introduces **Temporal‑powered orchestration**, **admission policies**, and **metering** – enabling signed bundles, safe execution, and usage‑based invoicing. |
| **C – Marketplace Alpha** | 3–5 weeks | Publish/install/update/revoke APIs, performance ranking, sandboxed tool execution, marketplace UI stub | Delivers the **Marketplace** with signed capsule publishing, **Tool Broker** sandboxing, and performance ranking – fulfilling the marketplace & pricing requirements. |
| **D – Global Scale** | Ongoing (post‑Alpha) | Multi‑region deployment, QoS lanes, disaster‑recovery drills, cross‑region data residency | Extends **zero‑trust mTLS**, **budget enforcement**, and **DR** to a global, multi‑tenant footprint – ensuring predictability and compliance at scale. |

## Phase‑by‑Phase Detailed Tasks (Development Plan)

### Phase A – Spine (Weeks 0‑4)
1. **Gateway API (Edge)** – JWT issuance, rate‑limit, region pinning, session minting.
2. **Core Orchestrator** – Turn loop, provenance tagging, streaming SSE/WS.
3. **Memory‑Recall Service** – Qdrant integration, provenance metadata, < 120 ms latency target.
4. **Event Bus & Dashboards** – Kafka topics for `gateway.audit`, `conversation.events`; Grafana dashboards for latency & token usage.
5. **Observability baseline** – Prometheus metrics, structured logs with `trace_id`.

### Phase B – Durable & Safe (Weeks 5‑9)
1. **Constitution Service** – SBOM verification, policy engine (OPA), signed bundle validation.
2. **Temporal Job Engine** – Deploy Temporal cluster, create `Job` workflow schema; integrate with Orchestrator (MAO placeholder).
3. **Remember Service** – Write‑through to Qdrant with access‑control, budget gating.
4. **Billing Ledger** – Postgres schema (`usage_ledger`), ClickHouse aggregation, OpenMeter/Lago integration for SKU pricing.
5. **Safety enforcement** – Circuit‑breaker, token‑budget throttling, audit logs for every policy decision.

### Phase C – Marketplace Alpha (Weeks 10‑14)
1. **Capsule Publishing API** – `POST /v1/agents/publish` with Cosign signature, SBOM storage, automated lint & perf test.
2. **Marketplace Backend** – PostgreSQL catalog, search indexes, performance ranking (latency, cost, reliability).
3. **Tool Broker Enhancements** – JSON‑schema validation, sandbox (Docker/Firecracker), streaming `tool.delta` events.
4. **Marketplace UI (stub)** – List curated capsules, pricing SKUs, compliance badges.
5. **Billing hooks** – Emit `billing.events` per capsule execution, reconcile with ledger.

### Phase D – Global Scale (Weeks 15‑∞)
1. **Multi‑region deployment** – Terraform/Helm scripts for EU & US clusters, data‑residency routing.
2. **QoS lanes** – Priority queues per‑tenant, token‑budget based throttling, brown‑out policies.
3. **Disaster‑Recovery drills** – Run `dr_failover_drill` capsule, validate RTO/RPO, update runbooks.
4. **Security hardening** – Full SPIRE mesh, Vault secret rotation, Nitro/SEV attestation where available.
5. **Observability at scale** – Loki aggregation, cross‑region Grafana dashboards, alerting on latency & budget overruns.

## How This Roadmap Serves the One‑Pager
- **Safety** – Phases A & B implement signed bundles, OPA policies, and mTLS.
- **Performance** – Phase A’s recall latency target, Phase B’s autoscaling (conductance) and queue sizing, Phase C’s tool‑broker streaming.
- **Economy** – Phase B introduces metering and SKU pricing; Phase C adds marketplace pricing; Phase D enforces budgets globally.
- **Proof** – Benchmarks are tied to each phase’s success criteria (latency, error‑rate, cost‑accuracy).
