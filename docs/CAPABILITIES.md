# Capabilities Matrix

Date: 2025-10-08

Perfect-world capabilities vs. current implementation status. This sets expectations and highlights next steps.

| Area | Perfect-world capability | Current status | Notes / Next steps |
|------|--------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| API Gateway | Production FastAPI gateway with auth, rate limiting, metrics | Partial | Core endpoints and /metrics exist; harden auth/rate limiting if needed |
| Orchestrator | Temporal-backed workflows with retries, history, metrics | Yes | Real workflows and a Prometheus Counter in analytics activity |
| Airflow | Scheduled batch jobs with centralized logging | Yes | Airflow service with DAG calling Gateway; logs to Loki |
| Flink | Streaming pipelines with connectors and sinks | Scaffold | Job scaffold and manifests present; implement connectors |
| Observability: Metrics | Prometheus scraping all services | Yes | ServiceMonitors configured; expose /metrics per service |
| Observability: Logs | Centralized structured logs | Yes | Loki deployed; Gateway/Orchestrator attach Loki handler via LOKI_URL |
| Observability: Dashboards | Visual analytics dashboards | Optional | Grafana not required; integrate any UI as needed |
| Tracing | End-to-end distributed tracing | Optional | Add OTLP exporters and Tempo/Jaeger if desired |
| Identity | OAuth/OIDC with roles and tenant isolation | Partial | Identity service exists; integration maturity varies per environment |
| Tool Service | Adapters for external systems | Partial | Tool service exists; verify required adapters for your use case |
| Memory Gateway | Vector/RAG memory access | Partial | Memory gateway exists; validate configuration for production |
| CI/CD | Build, test, deploy pipelines | Partial | Scripts present; wire into your CI system |
| Security | Policies, secrets management, TLS | Partial | Documented patterns; wire per environment |

Legend: Yes = implemented, Partial = present but needs hardening, Scaffold = initial code/manifests only.
