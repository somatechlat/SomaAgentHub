# SomaStack Cryptography & Security Controls

This single reference unifies every cryptography/security element scattered across the roadmap and sprint plans.

## Guiding Principles
- **Defense in depth** – auth, transport, and release signing layers ensure no single failure exposes the platform.
- **Deterministic math** – hashes/HMACs use canonical payloads so signatures are reproducible and tamper-evident.
- **Residency & isolation** – ingress checks tenant-region policy before requests reach stateful systems.
- **Forward-compatible** – mechanisms anticipate upgrades (mTLS, key rotation, immutable ledgers) without breaking current flows.

## Sprint Alignment

| Sprint | Focus Area | Security Deliverables |
|--------|------------|-----------------------|
| 4 | Hardening & Launch | JWT auth, gateway context middleware, kill-switch hooks; roadmap adds mTLS/SPIFFE, Vault secrets, dependency scanning. |
| 5 | AppSec & Compliance | Capability-scoped JWTs + MFA, moderation-before-orchestration, deny-by-default NetworkPolicies, OTEL/Prometheus audit dashboards, kill-switch runbooks. |
| 6 | Marketplace & Automation | Capsule attestation hashes/signatures, MAO template import with verified data, tool-service billing events from trusted metadata. |
| 7 | Analytics & Insights | Persona regression automation (`/v1/persona-regressions/transition`), anomaly scans, JSON exports scoped by tenant/window, governance reports. |
| 8 | Scalability & Multi-region | Gateway residency allow-list, disaster recovery capsule + scripts + analytics (`/v1/drills/disaster`, `/v1/drills/disaster/summary`), roadmap items for per-region encryption keys and Terraform failover automation. |

## Component Details

### Gateway API
- **JWT verification** using secrets loaded through `somagent_secrets` (HMAC-SHA256 or issuer algorithm).
- **Residency enforcement** via `SOMAGENT_GATEWAY_RESIDENCY_ALLOWED`; mismatched tenants are blocked with 403 before hitting orchestration (`services/gateway-api/app/core/middleware.py`).
- **Context integrity** stored in `contextvars` (`services/gateway-api/app/core/context.py`), preventing cross-request leakage.

### Tool Service
- **Release signing**: canonical JSON manifests hashed with SHA-256, wrapped in HMAC-SHA256. Validation recomputes digest and applies constant-time comparison (`services/tool-service/app/core/security.py`).
- **Billing telemetry**: after sandbox execution, trusted metadata posts to analytics (`services/tool-service/app/api/routes.py`). Unverified adapters never run.

### Marketplace Capsule Repo
- **Submission integrity**: `POST /v1/submissions` requires attestation hash; reviewer history stored in Postgres.
- **Installation audit**: `/v1/installations` tracks tenant/environment status for compliance and rollback.

### Analytics Service
- **JSON exports only** (`/v1/exports/capsule-runs`, `/v1/exports/billing-ledger`) with optional filters.
- **Persona automation & anomaly alerts**: `/v1/persona-regressions/transition`, `/v1/anomalies/scan` maintain audit traces.
- **Disaster recovery metrics**: `/v1/drills/disaster` and `/v1/drills/disaster/summary` capture RTO/RPO and push notifications when drills fail.

### Disaster Recovery Automation
- Capsule `dr_failover_drill` + script `scripts/ops/run_failover_drill.sh` coordinate failover steps, then push metrics to analytics.
- Script `scripts/ops/schedule_dr_drill.py` imports the capsule into MAO and schedules periodic drills.

## Future Enhancements
1. **mTLS + SPIFFE** (Sprint 8 roadmap) to replace shared secrets for inter-service auth.
2. **Immutable analytics ledger** – Merkle chains or append-only stores for billing/dr drill events.
3. **Signed exports** – wrap JSON exports in detached digital signatures (Ed25519/PGP) for downstream verification.
4. **Key rotation automation** – via Vault/KMS for JWT & release-signing secrets.
5. **Persistent analytics store** – move in-memory drill/billing data into Postgres with row-level HMACs.
