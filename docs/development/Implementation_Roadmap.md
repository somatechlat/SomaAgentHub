# SomaStack Implementation Roadmap

This plan translates the master roadmap into actionable, parallel workstreams. It assumes SomaStack = SomaGent + SomaBrain + SomaFractalMemory + supporting infra (Kafka/KRaft, Postgres, Redis, Quadrant, Prometheus + SomaSuite Observability Console).

## Guiding Principles
- **Math-first**: measure everything (latency, tokens, WER/MOS, recall precision) and adjust via benchmarks/telemetry.
- **Simplicity**: prefer clear interfaces, idempotent APIs, well-scoped services.
- **Observability**: every feature ships with metrics, traces, and audit trails.
- **Parallelism**: decompose work into independent tracks so multiple contributors can move concurrently; see the [Parallel Sprint Execution Playbook](Parallel_Sprint_Execution.md) for squad structure and wave cadence.

## Workstreams Overview
1. **Core Memory & Constitution** – wiring SomaBrain + SomaFractalMemory, constitution validation, sync safety.
2. **SLM Execution** – async workers, HTTP fallback, provider scoring, benchmarks.
3. **Agent Orchestration & Policy** – gateway, orchestrator, MAO, policy enforcement.
4. **Settings, Identity, Notifications** – tenant management, deployment modes, notification orchestrator.
5. **UI/Experience** – admin console, conversational workspace, Agent One Sight dashboard.
6. **Infrastructure & Ops** – Kafka/Postgres/Redis/Quadrant setup, CI/CD, observability.

Each workstream below lists milestones, dependencies, and parallelizable subtasks.

---

## 1. Core Memory & Constitution
**Goal**: reliable read/write to SomaBrain, constitution enforcement, offline sync.

### 1.1 Client Libraries (Run in parallel)
- Implement `somagent_memory` client (Python) to wrap `/remember`, `/recall`, `/rag/retrieve`, `/wm/*`, `/link` with tenant headers, retries, idempotent IDs.
- Implement constitution client hitting `/constitution/version|load|validate|checksum` with Redis caching.

### 1.2 Service Integration
- Wire Memory Gateway to SomaBrain client (read/write, offline buffer via Redis streams).
- Constitution service: signature verification, checksum publishing (`constitution.updated` Kafka event).

### 1.3 Sync & Resilience
- Implement transactional outbox pattern for memory writes (Postgres table + background dispatcher to SomaBrain).
- Background reconciler draining offline buffer after outages; emit metrics (backlog age, replay rate).

### 1.4 Testing & Benchmarks
- Memory regression capsule: insert set of docs, recall with cues, assert ranking & latency thresholds.
- Constitution integration test: load > validate > orchestrator hits `/v1/sessions/start` and blocks on invalid hash.

**Dependencies**: SomaBrain running (9696); Redis, Kafka, Postgres available.

---

## 2. SLM Execution
**Goal**: hybrid async/sync inference with model scoring + telemetry.

### 2.1 HTTP Fallback Routes
- Implement `/infer_sync` and `/embedding` handlers in `services/slm-service`, aligning with OpenAPI.
- Add provider adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama local) with token/latency logging.

### 2.2 Async Workers
- Define request queue schema (Kafka topic `slm.requests`, dead-letter queue).
- Worker service consuming requests, calling providers, streaming responses to orchestrator.

### 2.3 Metrics & Benchmark Harness
- Emit `slm.metrics` events containing tokens, latency, refusal rate.
- Temporal workflow to run nightly benchmark capsules; store results in Postgres + SomaBrain.
- Notification orchestrator: Kafka consumer + websocket (`/ws/notifications/{tenant}`) broadcasting alerts.
- MAO service uses Postgres tables + worker to execute workflows via orchestrator `/v1/sessions/start`.
- Benchmark service (FastAPI) hitting SLM HTTP fallback, persisting results in Postgres (`benchmark_results`), exposing `/v1/run` and `/v1/scores` for scoring service.

### 2.4 Model Profiles & Scoring
- Extend settings service with `model_profiles` table & API (chat/planning/code/embedding/voice).
- Scoring service implementing `score(model, task)`; auto-suggest promotions.

**Parallel tasks**: adapters independent from queue plumbing; benchmarks can start once sync endpoints exist.

---

## 3. Agent Orchestration & Policy
**Goal**: enforce constitution, manage sessions, integrate MAO.

### 3.1 Gateway & Orchestrator Foundation
- Implement JWT/capability middleware, request context (tenant, user, deployment mode).
- `POST /v1/sessions/start` orchestrator flow: policy check → memory call → SLM request.
- Integrate two-key approval logic (policy + human) hooking into notification system.

### 3.2 Policy Engine
- Implement scoring weights, connection to constitution service.
- Expose `/v1/evaluate` returning score + reason codes; orchestrator attaches to tool actions.

### 3.3 Multi-Agent Orchestrator (Temporal)
- Define workflow schema for capsules (plan → tasks → approvals).
- Add connectors to notification orchestrator for wait states.
- ✅ v0 implementation live: `multi-agent-orchestration-workflow` coordinating agent directives, issuing identity tokens, dispatching notifications via `POST /v1/notifications`, and surfacing orchestration status through `/v1/mao/*` API routes.

### 3.4 Offline Sync
- Ensure request context includes `client_type` so local/offline devices queue operations properly.
- Document outbox replay API for clients (UI/CLI/IDE).

**Dependencies**: Memory Gateway (for recall), SLM fallback (for quick responses).

---

## 4. Settings, Identity, Notifications
**Goal**: configurable multi-tenant controls, deployment modes, notification feeds.

### 4.1 Identity Service
- Build user/tenant models, capability claims, training lock flow (`/v1/training/start|stop`).
- Integrate with JWT signing (initial simple secret → move to JWKS later).

### 4.2 Settings Service
- CRUD for tenant settings, model profiles, notification preferences (`notification_preferences` table).
- Emit `settings.changed` Kafka events; provide version hashes.

### 4.3 Notification Orchestrator
- Service listening to `notifications.events`; pushes WebSocket updates, optional email/SMS connectors.
- Implement quiet hours, severity filters.
- ✅ FastAPI notification service online with `/v1/notifications` enqueue + `/v1/notifications/backlog` inspection endpoints, Kafka-ready bus, and pytest coverage.

### 4.4 Deployment Mode Automation
- Settings endpoints to switch `SOMAGENT_DEPLOYMENT_MODE`, enforce guardrails per mode (mock providers in dev, strict audits in prod).

**Parallel tasks**: identity and settings can proceed concurrently; notification orchestrator depends on Kafka setup.

---

## 5. UI / Experience
**Goal**: deliver admin console, conversation workspace, Agent One Sight dashboard.

### 5.1 Component Library
- Scaffold React/Vite workspace (`apps/admin-console`), set up Tailwind + Radix + Storybook.
- Build shared components (`@somagent/uix` package) for buttons, cards, notification tray, conversation timeline.

### 5.2 Admin Console Modules
- Settings forms, model profile editor, deployment mode wizard.
- Agent One Sight dashboard: LED indicators, KPI tiles, anomaly timeline, benchmark charts.

### 5.3 Conversational Workspace
- WebSockets for live conversation, persona selector, tool trace, proof-of-thought, approvals.
- Voice controls: integrate WebRTC capture, streaming waveforms, connect to SLM audio endpoints.

### 5.4 Notification Center & Marketplace
- Implement notification tray, digest preferences.
- Persona/capsule gallery + builder with YAML preview.

**Parallel tasks**: component library + storybook can proceed while backend APIs land; conversation workspace awaits gateway/orchestrator endpoints.

---

## 6. Infrastructure & Ops
**Goal**: reliable local/prod environments with observability and CI/CD.

### 6.1 Local Compose Stack
- docker-compose including Kafka/KRaft, Postgres, Redis, SomaBrain, SLM fallback, Prometheus, and SomaSuite telemetry adapters.
- Provide seed scripts for demo data (tenants, personas, capsules).

### 6.2 CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions: lint (Ruff, ESLint), type check (mypy, tsc), tests (pytest, Playwright), Docker builds, vulnerability scan, optional dockerhub push.

### 6.3 Observability
- Standard metrics exporters for each service; dashboards (Agent One Sight, SomaBrain internals, SLM metrics).
- Alerting rules (Kafka lag, memory backlog, refusal spikes).

### 6.4 Security Hardening
- mTLS/SPIFFE integration plan, Vault secrets loader, dependency scanning, SAST/DAST integration.

**Dependencies**: baseline service implementations to emit metrics; security work ongoing parallel to features.

---

## Timeline Sketch (rolling 12 weeks)
- **Weeks 0–2**: SomaBrain client + constitution integration, SLM fallback endpoints, gateway scaffolding, local compose stack.
- **Weeks 3–5**: Async SLM workers, policy engine, identity/settings APIs, conversation workspace (text), basic notification feed.
- **Weeks 6–8**: Benchmarks, model profiles scoring, Agent One Sight dashboard, MAO workflow v1, audio pipeline integration.
- **Weeks 9–12**: Marketplace builder, notification orchestrator enhancements, deployment mode automation, security hardening, load/chaos tests.

Adjust timeline based on team capacity; workstreams allow for parallel squads (Memory/Policy, SLM, UI/Notifications, Infra).

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Sprint 0)
1. Finalize SomaBrain client + constitution caching (Memory Gateway).
2. Implement SLM `/infer_sync` & `/embedding` with provider adapters.
3. Scaffold Gateway auth middleware + request context.
4. Build docker-compose (Kafka/KRaft, Postgres, Redis, SomaBrain) and document usage.
5. Set up Storybook + component library skeleton for admin console.

After Sprint 0, evaluate telemetry and iterate on benchmarks + orchestration flows.

Adjust timelines per capacity; each milestone maps to backlog items in the main roadmap.

### Sprint 4 – Hardening & Launch
- Security hardening (mTLS/SPIFFE, Vault integration, dependency scanning).
- Deployment automation (Helm charts, CI/CD pipelines).
- Load/chaos tests across SomaStack (k6, fault injection).
- Documentation polish and legal review.

### Sprint 5 – Advanced Security & Observability
- Ship capability-scoped JWTs and MFA enrollment flows; orchestrator enforces deny-by-default when claims missing.
- Apply Kubernetes NetworkPolicies for deny-by-default service mesh; document tenant-specific exceptions.
- Insert moderation-before-orchestration in gateway path with strike counters stored in Redis/Postgres.
- Wrap tool adapters in sandboxed jobs (signed releases, per-adapter rate limits).
- Enable OpenTelemetry + Prometheus dashboards covering compliance/audit KPIs.
- Draft and test kill-switch/constitution-update runbooks (store in `docs/runbooks/`).

### Sprint 6 – Marketplace & Automation
- Harden capsule marketplace flows: submission attestation, compliance linting, reviewer approvals, and rejection workflows. (`POST /v1/submissions`, `GET /v1/submissions`, `POST /v1/submissions/{id}/review` now persist state in Postgres and surface compliance context in responses.)
- Automate MAO template import: `POST /v1/templates/import` pulls approved capsules from the task-capsule-repo, converts workflow steps into template instructions, optionally instantiates default workflows, and wires recurring schedules in one call.
- Automate workflow templates: MAO clones capsule graphs into tenant workflows, parameterizes steps, and stores recurring schedules.
- Add billing hooks (per-token, per-capsule) with exportable ledgers for downstream billing lakes (`POST /v1/billing/events`, `GET /v1/billing/ledgers`, JSON export at `/v1/exports/billing-ledger`). Tool-service now posts billing events after adapter runs (using adapter billing metadata).
- Expand tool adapter release verification with signed metadata (auto-generated connectors tracked separately). Tool registry entries now include signed manifests (`manifest` + `manifest_digest`) and the service verifies canonical digests before execution.
- Ship install/update/rollback endpoints for marketplace capsules to back CLI or SDK flows (`POST /v1/installations`, `GET /v1/installations`, `POST /v1/installations/{id}/rollback`).

- Build capsule analytics dashboards (success rates, SLA, token cost, revision counts) via analytics-service `/v1/dashboards/capsules` (supports optional `tenant_id` + `window_hours` filters).
- Implement persona regression automation endpoints to queue/execute regressions and surface notifications (`POST /v1/persona-regressions/transition`, `/v1/persona-regressions/run`, `/v1/persona-regressions/due`).
- Add anomaly detection on capsule success rates with tenant alerts and notification feed exposure (triggered via `/v1/anomalies/scan`).
- Introduce tenant-facing data export APIs (JSON) with scoped access for billing and analytics pipelines (e.g., `/v1/exports/capsule-runs?tenant_id=...`, `/v1/exports/billing-ledger?tenant_id=...`).
- Publish governance reports (policy changes, constitutional updates, strike heatmaps) via analytics-service `/v1/governance/reports`.

### Sprint 8 – Scalability & Multi-region
- Deliver multi-region deployment manifests (Terraform + Helm) with active-active Postgres and SomaBrain replicas.
- Deliver multi-region deployment manifests (Terraform skeleton in `infra/terraform/` + Helm overlays per region) with active-active Postgres and SomaBrain replicas.
- Enforce data residency policies via partitioned schemas, per-region encryption keys, and residency-aware routing.
- Enforce data residency policies via partitioned schemas, per-region encryption keys, and residency-aware routing (gateway enforces allowed tenant lists per region before forwarding requests).
- Implement automated disaster recovery drills (capsule `dr_failover_drill`) and document RTO/RPO results via analytics-service `/v1/drills/disaster` + `/v1/drills/disaster/summary` and runbook script `scripts/ops/run_failover_drill.sh`.
- Add autoscaling policies (KEDA/HPAs) tuned via load benchmarks; validate Quadrant/Redis sharding strategies.
- Integrate cross-region observability (federated Prometheus, Tempo traces) with tenant-aware drill-downs.

- Run staged release candidates following `docs/release/Release_Candidate_Playbook.md`; finalize GA via launch readiness checklist.
- Run staged release candidates following `docs/release/Release_Candidate_Playbook.md`; finalize GA via launch readiness checklist (`scripts/perf/profile_gateway.sh` for perf validation).
- Prepare community enablement: contributor guidelines, template repos, marketing kit, and release notes template.

### Sprint 10 – KAMACHIQ Mode Automation
- Deliver KAMACHIQ-mode planner and governance capsules (`kamachiq_project_planner`, `kamachiq_governance_review`) in task capsule repo.
- Implement planner blueprint (`docs/KAMACHIQ_Mode_Blueprint.md`) and provisioning harness (`scripts/kamachiq/provision_stack.sh`).
- Extend MAO to support templated instantiation and schedule orchestration for planner outputs (automation harness example: `scripts/ops/schedule_dr_drill.py`).
