## 1. Vision check-in
SomaGent orchestrates autonomous agent work across personas, capsules, and real-world tools. The roadmap aligns execution with the architecture blueprint, ensuring each increment delivers working, production-ready capabilities without mock substitutes. Every milestone is validated against the guiding principles established in `SomaGent_Platform_Architecture.md`.

## 2. Program structure
- **Program duration**: ~20 weeks across five phases, adaptable per velocity.
- **Sprint cadence**: 2-week sprints with parallel tracks (Platform, Security/Governance, AI Runtime, Marketplace, Observability, DevX).
- **Governance**: Bi-weekly architecture sync, sprint reviews, and monthly risk assessment.
- **Environment strategy**: Dev → Staging → Production with GitOps promotion gates.

## 3. Phase overview

## 7. Dependencies & integration points
- Temporal ↔ Ray: ensure worker autoscaling handles SLM load.
- Keycloak ↔ OPA/OpenFGA: consistent tenants/capabilities across identity and policy layers.
- Hasura ↔ Postgres ↔ Temporal: GraphQL API triggers workflows; align schema migrations.
- ClickHouse ↔ Kafka Streams: maintain schema registry alignment; plan capacity for 30-day retention.
- Vault ↔ GitOps: secret rotation must propagate to workloads without manual edit.

## 8. Governance and reviews
- Sprint Review (bi-weekly): cross-functional demo, KPI check.
- Architecture Sync (monthly): confirm adherence to architecture doc, adjust blueprint if needed.
- Security/Compliance Review (monthly): evaluate policy coverage, audit outcomes, risk register updates.
- Chaos/Postmortem Review (on demand): after major drills or incidents, feed learnings into roadmap.

## 9. Risk radar
| Category | Risk | Mitigation | Watch level |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Technical | Workflow scale-out misconfiguration | Temporal monitoring, load testing, auto-scaling policies | Medium |
| Security | Policy drift / manual overrides | GitOps-managed policies, automated regression suite | High |
| Product | Marketplace adoption slower than expected | Seed internal capsules, leverage evangelism, gather tenant feedback | Medium |
| Operations | Tool adapter integration delays | Prioritize early adapter inventory, reuse open-source connectors, maintain sandbox standards | Medium |
| Compliance | Evidence collection lags | Automate evidence capture, assign owner per control, weekly audit check | Medium |

## 10. Next steps & checkpoints
1. Approve roadmap and align cross-functional owners per track.
2. Kick off Sprint 0A planning with detailed task breakdowns and capacity estimates.
3. Set up roadmap tracking in Backstage or project management tool (e.g., Linear/Jira) with sprint boards per track.
4. Schedule milestone reviews and risk radar updates in team calendar.
5. Sync roadmap document quarterly (or after major change) to keep architecture alignment intact.
