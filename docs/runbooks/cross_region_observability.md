# Cross-Region Observability Playbook

Use this guide to configure federated Prometheus and Tempo tracing across SomaStack regions.

## Prometheus Federation
1. Deploy a central Prometheus in the primary region.
2. Scrape regional Prometheus instances using federation:
   ```yaml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'somastack-federation'
       honor_labels: true
       metrics_path: /federate
       params:
         'match[]':
           - '{__name__=~"gateway_.*"}'
           - '{__name__=~"tool_service_.*"}'
       static_configs:
         - targets:
             - prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090         # primary
             - prometheus.monitoring.eu-west.svc.cluster.local:9090 # failover
   ```
3. Label metrics with `region` (already present in Helm chart labels) to support drill-down dashboards.

## Tempo (or Jaeger) Tracing
- Deploy Tempo/Jaeger per region.
- Configure OTEL exporters in each service (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`) to point to the regional collector.
- Use Tempo’s multi-tenancy or Loki for cross-region storage, or push traces to a central Tempo gateway.

## Dashboards
- SomaSuite observability console: import dashboards that include `region` templating variable. Example panels:
  - Gateway RPS split by region (`sum(rate(gateway_requests_total[5m])) by (region)`)
  - DR drill RTO/RPO over time via analytics-service JSON data source.

## Alerts
- Prometheus alerting rules should include region labels and route notifications to region-specific channels (Ops US vs Ops EU).
- Alerts:
  - `GatewayAvailabilityDrop` – `<50%` success in one region.
  - `DRDrillFailure` – analytics webhook posts to Alertmanager when `/v1/drills/disaster` records `succeeded=false`.

Keep this playbook updated as observability stack evolves.
