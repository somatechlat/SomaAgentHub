# Constitution Update Runbook

This runbook governs the process for publishing a new SomaAgentHub constitution package to SomaBrain and propagating it to all services.

## Preconditions
- Draft constitution reviewed and signed by authorized maintainer (PGP or Sigstore artifact).
- Regression tests passing (`tests/policy` and `tests/chaos`).
- Change request approved by governance board.

## Update Workflow
1. **Stage the Artifact**
   - Upload the signed document to SomaBrain storage via `constitution-service` CLI.
   - Command example: `python -m constitution_client push --path constitution_vX.Y.json --signature path.sig`.
2. **Validate Signature**
   - Call `POST /v1/constitution/validate` on constitution-service.
   - Verify response `{ "valid": true, "checksum": "..." }`.
3. **Publish Version**
   - Trigger `POST /v1/constitution/load` to load the new version into Postgres and emit `constitution.updated` Kafka event.
   - Confirm Redis cache refresh (`constitution-service` logs should show new checksum).
4. **Orchestrator Sync**
   - Orchestrator automatically fetches latest version on next request. Force refresh via `POST /v1/sessions/start` with `deployment_mode=production-debug` to confirm policy hash.
   - Monitor Prometheus metric `policy_engine_evaluations_total` for spike anomalies.
5. **Broadcast**
   - Notify teams in #release channel with checksum, effective time, and change summary.

## Rollback Plan
- Keep previous constitution artifact accessible.
- To rollback, repeat the publish sequence with the prior version.
- Clear Redis cache manually if necessary (`redis-cli DEL constitution:current`).

## Audit & Logging
- Ensure `constitution.updated` Kafka topic ingested by SIEM.
- Store signature artifacts in `docs/legal/constitution/` for audit packages.
   - Update `docs/SomaAgentHub_Security.md` change log with version, approvers, and date.
