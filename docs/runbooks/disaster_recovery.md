# Disaster Recovery Runbook

Use this playbook to execute regional failover tests and real incidents across the SomaStack (SomaGent + SomaBrain + SomaFractalMemory).

## 1. Assumptions
- Active primary region (e.g., `us-east-1`) with warm standby in a secondary region (`eu-west-1`).
- Kafka MirrorMaker or equivalent replicates topics required for orchestration (`agent.events`, `project.events`, `notifications.events`).
- Postgres uses logical replication (read replica promoted in failover region) and WAL archiving to object storage.
- SomaBrain deployments are isolated per region with periodic snapshot replication and tenant residency guards.

## 2. Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Secondary region Helm release deployed (`infra/k8s/overlays/<region>` values).
- [ ] Cross-region network paths tested (service mesh / internal DNS).
- [ ] Terraform state for infra stored in remote backend (S3 + DynamoDB or GCS).
- [ ] Secrets synchronized via Vault replication or per-region KMS.
- [ ] Chaos test windows scheduled with stakeholders notified.

## 3. Failover Drill (Planned)
1. **Announce window** in #ops + incident board; freeze non-essential deploys.
2. **Disable primary ingress** for gateway (set HPA min/max to 0 or scale deployment to 0).
3. **Promote Postgres replica** in secondary region:
   - `SELECT pg_promote();` on replica.
   - Update DNS / connection strings (`postgres-primary.<region>.svc`).
4. **Switch Kafka clients** to secondary bootstrap servers (update Helm values or config map, roll deployments).
5. **Enable secondary gateway** (increase HPA min replicas, ensure LoadBalancer healthy).
6. **Flush caches**: clear Redis constitution hash via `FLUSHDB` in secondary region.
7. **Run smoke tests**: `POST /v1/sessions` (gateway), `POST /v1/remember` (memory), sample capsule execution.
8. **Monitor**: check Prometheus dashboards for error spikes and ensure notifications flow.
9. **Document findings** and restore primary region (reverse above steps, demote secondary if needed).

Automation helper:
```
PRIMARY_REGION=us-east-1 FAILOVER_REGION=eu-west-1 ANALYTICS_URL=http://localhost:8930/v1 \
  scripts/ops/run_failover_drill.sh
```
The script captures RTO/RPO automatically by calling `POST /v1/drills/disaster` on the analytics-service.

### Scheduling drills via MAO
```
python scripts/ops/schedule_dr_drill.py \
  http://localhost:8200 \
  tenant-a \
  ops-automation \
  --cron "0 4 * * 1"
```
This imports the `dr_failover_drill` capsule, schedules it (via KEDA/MAO), and records IDs for audit logs.

## 4. Emergency Failover (Unplanned)
- If primary region is unreachable:
  1. Trigger kill switch (see `kill_switch.md`) to halt new sessions.
  2. Promote standby Postgres immediately.
  3. Point DNS/global load balancers to secondary gateway.
  4. Rebuild missing Kafka partitions from MirrorMaker snapshots.
  5. Update SomaBrain clients to point to secondary API (SomaBrain is multi-region but enforces tenant residency: EU tenants remain in EU region even during US outage).
  6. Announce status every 15 minutes.

## 5. Post-incident Recovery
- Re-sync data from secondary back to primary (Postgres incremental backup, Kafka mirror sync, SomaBrain snapshot restore).
- Run integrity checks:
  - Capsule installation history (`settings-service` `/v1/marketplace/.../installations`).
  - Billing ledgers (`/v1/billing/ledgers/{tenant}`).
  - Analytics exports to ensure no gaps.
- File retrospective, update runbooks with lessons learned.

## 6. Data Residency Considerations
- Do **not** move EU tenant data to US region; failover EU workloads only within EU cluster.
- Gateway environment variables (`SOMAGENT_GATEWAY_RESIDENCY_*`) ensure policy engine enforces residency. Verify values after redeploy.
- Analytics exports and billing ledgers should be written to region-specific buckets (configure via Helm values or secrets).

## 7. Automation Backlog
- Scripted failover using Terraform + Argo Rollouts to reduce manual steps.
- Integrate with Temporal workflows for periodic DR drills and reporting to analytics-service (`/v1/drills/disaster`).
- Capture metrics (`dr_failover_duration_seconds`, `dr_last_drill_timestamp`) for compliance dashboards.
