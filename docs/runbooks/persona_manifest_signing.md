# Persona Manifest Signing Runbook

This runbook covers the provisioning of signing keys, enabling the constitution-service signing endpoint, and wiring the orchestrator exporter to attach signatures to persona manifests.

## 1. Provision Signing Keys
- Generate an Ed25519 keypair (PyNaCl compatible). Example:
  ```bash
  python - <<'PY'
  from nacl import signing
  key = signing.SigningKey.generate()
  with open('constitution_private_key.pem', 'wb') as priv:
      priv.write(key.encode())
  with open('constitution_public_key.pem', 'wb') as pub:
      pub.write(key.verify_key.encode())
  PY
  ```
- Store the private key securely (Vault/KMS) and distribute read access only to constitution-service.
- Distribute the public key to verification clients (orchestrator, marketplace, auditors).

## 2. Configure constitution-service
- Mount or inject the private key into the service container at runtime.
- Set one of the following to point at the key paths:
  - `SOMAGENT_SIGNING_KEY=/secrets/constitution_private_key.pem`
  - `SOMAGENT_PUBLIC_KEY=/secrets/constitution_public_key.pem`
  - or rely on `SOMAGENT_CONSTITUTION_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` / `SOMAGENT_CONSTITUTION_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` to override defaults.
- On startup the service now loads the signer and exposes `POST /v1/sign/persona-manifest`.
- Health-check: call the endpoint with a sample manifest to ensure a signature bundle is returned.

## 3. Orchestrator Integration
- Ensure `services/orchestrator/app/core/config.py` is configured with the signing endpoint:
  - `CONSTITUTION_SERVICE_URL` (defaults to `http://constitution-service:8007/v1`).
  - `MANIFEST_SIGNING_ENABLED=true` to activate the HTTP client.
  - Optional: `MANIFEST_SIGNING_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to tune latency budgets.
- During export the orchestrator now requests a signature and writes it into the manifest under the `signature` field.

## 4. Verification & Auditing
- Every manifest now includes:
  ```yaml
  signature:
    algorithm: ed25519
    signature: <base64>
    public_key: <base64>
    digest: <sha3-256>
    signed_at: 2025-10-05T00:00:00Z
  ```
- Downstream consumers should recompute the canonical JSON digest (sorted keys, UTF-8) and verify with the published public key.
- Monitor constitution-service logs for `manifest signing disabled` warnings; these indicate missing keys or misconfiguration.

## 5. Incident Response
- If a private key leak is suspected, rotate immediately:
  1. Disable publication (`MANIFEST_SIGNING_ENABLED=false`) to stop new exports.
  2. Generate a new keypair and update constitution-service.
  3. Re-sign outstanding manifests and notify marketplace partners with new public key hash.

Refer to `docs/schemas/persona_manifest.schema.json` for the canonical field definitions and version history.
