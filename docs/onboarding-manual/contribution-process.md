# Contribution Process (Onboarding) - Stub

This is a short onboarding-oriented contribution process. For full contributor rules, see:
- `../development-manual/contribution-process.md`

Steps for a quick first contribution:
1. Pick an issue tagged `good-first-issue`.
2. Create a branch `feat/<short-descriptor>` from `main`.
3. Make changes and run tests locally.
4. Open a PR and request a reviewer from the owning team.
