## üí¨ Communication

We are an async-first team, but we value real-time collaboration when needed.

### Primary Channels
- **Slack**: For daily communication, questions, and announcements.
- **GitHub**: For all code-related discussions (issues and pull requests).
- **Zoom**: For scheduled meetings.

### Slack Channels
- **`#somagenthub-general`**: General announcements and discussions.
- **`#somagenthub-dev`**: Technical discussions, help with code.
- **`#somagenthub-alerts`**: Automated alerts from our production environment.
- **`#random`**: Water cooler chat, memes, and fun.

### Best Practices
- **Default to public channels**: Your question is likely helpful to others.
- **Use threads**: Keep conversations organized.
- **Be mindful of time zones**: We are a global team.

## ü§ù Code Review Process

Code reviews are a crucial part of our quality process and a great way to learn.

### Author's Responsibility
- **Submit a clear PR**: Fill out the template with a good description.
- **Keep it small**: Smaller PRs are easier and faster to review.
- **Self-review first**: Read through your own code before requesting a review.

### Reviewer's Responsibility
- **Be timely**: Aim to review PRs within 24 hours.
- **Be constructive**: Provide clear, actionable feedback.
- **Approve or request changes**: Be clear about the next steps.
