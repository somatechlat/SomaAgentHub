# SomaAgentHub System Architecture

**A detailed overview of the SomaAgentHub platform's components, design principles, and data flow.**

This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview for platform engineers, SREs, and system administrators. It details the microservices architecture, guiding principles, data flow patterns, and technology stack that power SomaAgentHub.

## 🎯 Guiding Principles

The architecture is built on a foundation of modern, cloud-native principles to ensure scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

| Principle | Description | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Microservices** | Each service is independently deployable, scalable, and maintainable. | 14+ FastAPI services, each in its own container. |
| **API-First Design** | Services communicate through well-defined, versioned APIs. | OpenAPI specifications for every service. |
| **Cloud-Native** | Designed for containerization and orchestration. | Kubernetes-native, 12-factor app methodology. |
| **Asynchronous & Event-Driven** | Long-running tasks are handled asynchronously for resilience. | Temporal for workflow orchestration, Redis for caching. |
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** | All infrastructure is defined and managed in version control. | Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and Terraform. |
| **Comprehensive Observability** | The system is designed to be monitored and understood. | Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, Loki logging. |
| **Security by Design** | Security is integrated at every layer of the platform. | JWT authentication, RBAC, secrets management. |

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

SomaAgentHub operates as a layered system, separating concerns from public-facing APIs down to the underlying infrastructure.

## ⚙️ Core Service Responsibilities

The platform is composed of specialized microservices, each with a distinct responsibility.

| Service | Port | Purpose & Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Gateway API** | 8080 | **Public Entry Point**: Handles all incoming traffic, authentication (JWT), rate limiting, request validation, and routing to internal services. Provides OpenAI-compatible endpoints. |
| **Orchestrator** | 1004 | **Workflow Coordination**: The "brain" of the system. Manages multi-agent workflows using Temporal, coordinates tasks, and maintains state for long-running processes. |
| **Identity Service** | 1007 | **Authentication & Authorization**: Manages users, tenants, and roles. Issues and validates JWT tokens and enforces Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). |
| **Policy Engine** | 1002 | **Governance & Safety**: Enforces constitutional rules and ethical constraints on agent behavior. Evaluates actions against defined policies before execution. |
| **Memory Gateway** | 8000 | **Intelligent Memory**: Provides semantic storage and retrieval for agent context and conversation history using the Qdrant vector database for RAG. |
| **SLM Service** | - | **Language Model Access**: Manages interactions with various LLMs, whether local models or external APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Azure). |
| **Tool Service** | - | **External Integrations**: Provides a registry and execution environment for 16+ adapters that connect agents to external tools like GitHub, Slack, and AWS. |
| **Analytics Service**| - | **Usage & Metrics**: Collects and processes data for reporting, cost tracking, and performance analytics, often using a ClickHouse backend. |

## 🔄 Data Flow & Communication

### Request Lifecycle Example: Chat Completion

1.  **Client Request**: A user sends a request to `POST /v1/chat/completions` on the **Gateway API**.
2.  **Authentication**: The Gateway API validates the JWT token with the **Identity Service**.
3.  **Routing**: The request is forwarded to the **Orchestrator Service**.
4.  **Policy Check**: The Orchestrator sends the prompt to the **Policy Engine** to ensure it complies with safety and governance rules.
5.  **Memory Retrieval**: The Orchestrator queries the **Memory Gateway** to fetch relevant context and conversation history for the user.
6.  **LLM Interaction**: The Orchestrator, now with full context, sends the enriched prompt to the **SLM Service** for processing by a language model.
7.  **Response & Memory Update**: The LLM's response is received. The Orchestrator sends the new conversation turn to the **Memory Gateway** to be stored.
8.  **Final Response**: The final response is streamed back through the Gateway API to the client.

### Asynchronous Workflows

For complex tasks (e.g., "research and write a report"), the Orchestrator initiates a **Temporal Workflow**. This workflow defines a series of durable tasks (activities) that are executed by worker agents, ensuring the process can survive crashes and run for hours or days if needed.
