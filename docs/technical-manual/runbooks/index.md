# SomaAgentHub Operational Runbooks

**A collection of step-by-step procedures for common operational tasks and alerts.**

This document serves as a central directory for runbooks. Each runbook provides a standardized procedure to diagnose and resolve common issues, ensuring fast and consistent incident response.

## üéØ How to Use These Runbooks

When an alert fires or an operational task is required, follow these steps:

1.  **Identify the Symptom**: Match the alert or issue to the corresponding runbook below.
2.  **Follow the Steps**: Execute the diagnostic and remediation steps exactly as described.
3.  **Document Actions**: Keep a record of the commands run and their output.
4.  **Escalate if Necessary**: If the runbook does not resolve the issue, follow the escalation path.
5.  **Contribute Back**: If you discover a new issue or a better procedure, update the relevant runbook via a pull request.
