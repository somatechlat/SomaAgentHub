## Historical Retrospectives

## Sprint 0 – Discovery & Alignment (2025-10-17)

### 1. Summary
- Completed repository-wide orchestration audit to understand current scheduler touchpoints.
- Identified observability coverage and gaps, producing baseline metrics plan and sandbox bootstrap script references.

### 2. What Went Well
- Rapidly mapped all Temporal workflows (sessions, marketing, MAO, Kamachiq) without code changes.
- Established documentation set (requirements brief, architecture RFC, baseline metrics plan) inside existing manual structure.

### 3. What Could Improve
- Need quantitative metrics (Prometheus exports, Temporal queue stats) sooner to validate assumptions.
- Align with leadership earlier on queue priorities to avoid rework in Sprint 1.

### 4. Action Items

| Item | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Export baseline Prometheus + Temporal metrics per plan | Platform Eng | 2025-10-24 | ☐ |
| Review queue hierarchy with platform leadership | Platform Lead | 2025-10-22 | ☐ |

### 5. Metrics & Evidence
- Requirements snapshot: `docs/development-manual/volcano-integration-notes/requirements.md`
- Architecture draft: `docs/development-manual/volcano-integration-notes/architecture-rfc.md`
- Baseline metrics plan: `docs/development-manual/volcano-integration-notes/baseline-metrics.md`

### 6. Follow-Up
- Kickoff Sprint 1 once metric exports begin.
- Schedule leadership review meeting week of 2025-10-20.
