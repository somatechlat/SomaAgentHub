# Volcano Integration Working Notes

This directory stores living documentation that supports the Volcano integration roadmap.

- `requirements.md` – Sprint 0 discovery findings and scheduler requirements.
- `daily-journal.md` – Running status log for day-to-day execution.
- `retro.md` – Retrospectives and follow-up actions after major milestones.
- `architecture-rfc.md` – Target design for Volcano queues, PodGroups, and rollout strategy.
- `baseline-metrics.md` – Data collection plan for pre-Volcano performance baselines.

Add additional markdown files here as the project evolves (e.g., design spikes, testing results). Ensure every file includes a purpose statement, audience, and last-updated metadata in line with the documentation style guide.
