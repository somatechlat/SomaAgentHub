⚠️ WE DO NOT MOCK we DO NOT IMITATE, WE DO NOT USE BYPASSES OR GIVE FAKE OR UNREAL VALUES TO PAST TESTS, we use MATH perfect math TO surpass any problem and we only abide truth and real serveres real data. Sabe this EVERYWHRE at the start of every Document!

# SomaGent Documentation

> **SomaGent Real-World Principle:** HERE IN THIS PROJECT WE DON'T MOCK, WE DON'T MIMIC, WE DON'T BYPASSWE ONLY USE REAL DATA, REAL SERVERS, REAL-WORLD SOFTWARE.

### Policy Engine
- **GET** `/v1/health/redis` – Simple health‑check that pings the Redis client (or placeholder) and returns `{"status": "ok"}` (200) or `{"status": "unavailable"}` (503).

## New Service Details

### Task Capsule Repository
- Stores **Task Capsules** in a PostgreSQL database with submission/review workflows.
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /v1/capsules` – list all capsules (filesystem + approved marketplace).
  - `GET /v1/capsules/{capsule_id}` – retrieve a specific capsule.
  - `POST /v1/submissions` – submit capsule for marketplace review.
  - `POST /v1/submissions/{id}/review` – approve/reject submissions.
  - `POST /v1/installations` – install approved capsules.
- Supports both filesystem-based capsules and marketplace submissions with approval workflows.

### Jobs
- Background job processing stores job metadata in memory (Redis integration planned).
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /v1/jobs` – submit a job (returns a UUID and status `queued`).
  - `GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}` – poll for status (`queued`, `running`, `completed`).
  - Health `/health` and metrics `/metrics` are exposed for Kubernetes probes.
- Runs on port **8000** with FastAPI backend.

## Integration‑Test Guidance

We provide a test scaffold under `services/policy-engine/tests/test_integration_flow.py` that demonstrates how to:

1. Spin up the **Identity Service** (via FastAPI `TestClient`).
2. Issue a JWT using the `/tokens/issue` endpoint.
3. Call the **Gateway API** to create a session.
4. Invoke the **Policy Engine** `/v1/evaluate` endpoint.
5. Use the **SLM producer** to send an `slm.requests` message and verify the `slm.responses` payload.

The scaffold uses **pytest**, **httpx**, and **unittest.mock** to stub out Kafka/Redis interactions, making the test runnable locally without full Docker‑Compose.

Refer to the file for detailed comments and replace the mocks with real testcontainers when you need end‑to‑end verification.
