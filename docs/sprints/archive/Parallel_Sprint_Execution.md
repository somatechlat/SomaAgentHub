# Parallel Sprint Execution Playbook

## Cadence Overview
- **Sprint window**: 2025-10-04 → 2025-10-18 (14 days), three concurrent tracks.
- **Streams**: Governance Core (Sprint 2), Runtime & Training (Sprint 3), Experience & Ecosystem (Sprint 4).
- **Daily syncs**: 15-minute cross-stream stand-up at 09:00 PT focusing on blockers and dependency handoffs.
- **Mid-sprint reviews**: Day 7 demos per stream; shared retrospective and planning on Day 14.

## Staffing Matrix
| Stream | Engineering Lead | Supporting Crews | Key Partners |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sprint 2 – Governance Core | Policy Lead (Ada) | Security Guild, Identity Ops | Gateway/API team |
| Sprint 3 – Runtime & Training | Runtime Lead (Kai) | Observability Pod, SLM Crew | Moderation Squad |
| Sprint 4 – Experience & Ecosystem | Experience Lead (Mira) | Frontend Guild, Analytics Crew | Marketplace Ops |

All crews operate with dedicated QA + DevRel liaison to keep documentation live. Unlimited capacity assumption allows on-demand staffing from shared pool while preserving clear ownership per stream.

## Related Artifacts
- [Wave schedule](Parallel_Wave_Schedule.md) translating roadmap work into overlapping commitments and integration milestones.
- Squad charters under `docs/sprints/squads/` detailing objectives, deliverables, dependencies, telemetry, and risks per squad.
- Development playbook updates in `../development/Parallel_Sprint_Execution.md` tracking automation + dashboard follow-ups.

## Workflow Agreements
- **Backlog slicing**: Each sprint board holds vertical slices with definition of done tying code, tests, runbooks, and telemetry.
- **Branching model**: Feature branches per task, PRs require cross-stream reviewer for dependency awareness.
- **Integration gates**: Shared staging environment resets nightly; automated smoke tests cover cross-service flows (policy → orchestrator → UI).
- **Telemetry contract**: Every endpoint ships with Prometheus metrics and structured logs; analytics pipeline consumes all new topics before acceptance.

## Risk Management
- Dependency tracker maintained in Linear workspace; items tagged `cross-stream` trigger escalation within 4 hours.
- Buffer team (“Tiger Crew”) rotates daily to swarm blockers or production issues without slowing sprint commitments.
- Weekly chaos drill rotates responsibility: Week 1 Governance, Week 2 Runtime, Week 3 Experience.

## Reporting
- Unified burndown chart aggregates story points per stream; individual velocity tracked for forecasting.
- Executive summary published Mondays covering status, risks, delivery confidence for all concurrent sprints.
- Public changelog updated as each sprint task merges to maintain transparency with downstream teams.
