- **Medium**: 500 concurrent users, 4 hours
- **Heavy**: 1000 concurrent users, 1 hour
- **Endurance**: 500 concurrent users, 24 hours
- **Spike**: 0 → 2000 → 0 in 10 minutes

### Security Tests
- Penetration testing (OWASP Top 10)
- Secret scanning in code and images
- Network policy validation
- mTLS enforcement verification
- Audit log completeness check

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### High Risk
**Chaos Experiments Cause Data Loss**
- Risk: Test failures corrupt production-like data
- Mitigation: Run chaos only in isolated staging, backup first
- Owner: Infra & Ops

**Load Testing Overwhelms Infrastructure**
- Risk: Tests crash cluster, impact other workloads
- Mitigation: Dedicated load testing namespace with quotas
- Owner: Infra & Ops

### Medium Risk
**mTLS Deployment Complexity**
- Risk: Certificate management issues break services
- Mitigation: Phased rollout, start with non-critical services
- Owner: Security Guild

**Performance Bottlenecks**
- Risk: Optimization needed, extends sprint timeline
- Mitigation: Focus on critical paths first, defer edge cases
- Owner: SLM Execution Squad
