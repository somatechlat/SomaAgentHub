# Sprint 4 — Experience & Ecosystem

Goal: Stand up the first admin console slice and marketplace scaffolding so operators can configure models, view token forecasts, and prepare capsule listings.

Top-level acceptance criteria:
- Admin Console (React + Tailwind) boots locally with Overview, Models & Providers, and Marketplace tabs wired to live APIs.
- Token Estimator service delivers baseline demand forecasts per provider and exposes `/v1/forecast` consumed by the UI.
- Marketplace service persists capsule metadata with attestation hashes and exposes `/v1/catalog/list` for the UI.
- Documentation updates walk operators through configuring model profiles and reviewing forecasts.

Tasks
- [ ] Scaffold admin console app with routing, layout shell, and shared design system tokens.
- [ ] Implement Models & Providers tab: list profiles from Settings service, allow switching primary provider, display token forecasts.
- [ ] Create Marketplace tab: list capsules from backend, show compliance badge + token estimate summary.
- [ ] Build Token Estimator FastAPI service with heuristics using historical `slm.metrics` data; add Prometheus metrics for prediction latency and MAPE.
- [ ] Extend Marketplace backend schema for attestation hash, reviewer workflow state, and compliance notes.
- [ ] Update operator documentation in `docs/Quickstart.md` and `docs/development/Implementation_Roadmap.md` with new UI flows.

Notes
- Coordinate with Analytics team to access `slm.metrics` history for estimator inputs.
- Ensure console integrates with SomaGent authentication (reuse Identity tokens from Sprint 2).
- Target responsive layout so the console works on tablets for field operators.
