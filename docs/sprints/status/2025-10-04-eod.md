# Wave Status ‚Äî 2025-10-04 (End of Day)

Parallel execution across three sprints delivered foundational implementations today. All squads advanced key deliverables with real service implementations (no mocks).

## Summary
- **Overall Health:** üü¢ Strong progress. Core components implemented across all three parallel sprints.
- **Active Sprints:** Sprint-2 (Governance Core), Sprint-3 (Runtime & Training), Sprint-4 (Experience & Ecosystem) all advancing simultaneously.
- **Implementation Velocity:** 6 major deliverables completed across policy, identity, orchestrator, training, UI, and estimator tracks.

## Sprint Progress

| Sprint | Completions Today | Status | Next Priorities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sprint-2 ‚Äì Governance Core | Policy Engine Redis rule store, Identity service complete with JWT rotation | üü¢ 40% Complete | Constitution sync, Gateway enforcement, Runbook updates |
| Sprint-3 ‚Äì Runtime & Training | Orchestrator streaming endpoints (`/v1/conversation/*`), Training mode controller | üü¢ 40% Complete | Gateway handshake, Observability instrumentation, Integration tests |
| Sprint-4 ‚Äì Experience & Ecosystem | Admin console scaffold (React/Vite/Tailwind), Token estimator service | üü¢ 33% Complete | Wire live APIs to UI tabs, Marketplace backend schema |

## Deliverables Completed (2025-10-04)

### Sprint-2: Governance Core
- ‚úÖ **Policy Engine**: Added Redis-backed rule pack persistence (`services/policy-engine/app/core/rule_store.py`) with lifespan caching
- ‚úÖ **Identity Service**: JWT rotation + Kafka audit trail already complete from earlier sprint work

### Sprint-3: Runtime & Training Slice
- ‚úÖ **Orchestrator Streaming**: Implemented `/v1/conversation/step` (sync) and `/v1/conversation/stream` (SSE) with policy header validation and `conversation.events` emission (`services/orchestrator/app/api/conversation.py`)
- ‚úÖ **Training Mode Controller**: Redis-backed lock endpoints (`/v1/training/enable|disable|status`) with `training.audit` Kafka emissions (`services/orchestrator/app/api/training.py`)

### Sprint-4: Experience & Ecosystem
- ‚úÖ **Admin Console**: Full React scaffold with routing, Tailwind design system, three pages (Overview, Models/Providers, Marketplace) (`apps/admin-console/`)
- ‚úÖ **Token Estimator Service**: FastAPI service with `/v1/forecast` endpoints, Prometheus metrics, heuristic baseline forecasts (`services/token-estimator/`)

## Integration Day Prep (Oct 8)
- [ ] Recorded API contracts needed: `/v1/evaluate` (Policy), `/v1/conversation/stream` (Orchestrator), `/v1/training/status` (Training)
- [ ] Kafka topics validated: `conversation.events`, `training.audit`
- [ ] Admin console needs `pnpm install` + live API wiring to backend services

## Blockers & Dependencies
- **Kafka topic provisioning**: Still pending from Infra & Ops for full end-to-end Kafka validation
- **Constitution sync**: Memory squad to publish signature verification logic and Redis warmers
- **Admin console live data**: Needs recorded contracts from backend squads to populate UI with real responses

## Metrics & Quality
- All new services include Prometheus instrumentation
- Policy Engine enforces deterministic scoring with constitution hash tracking
- Training mode supports admin-only capabilities (pending Identity integration)
- Admin console uses production-ready tooling (Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind)

## Next Actions (2025-10-05)
1. **Sprint-2**: Ravi to publish constitution cache warm-up implementation; Noah to scaffold Gateway policy header middleware
2. **Sprint-3**: Noah to implement Gateway streaming handshake; Lina to add structured logging + trace IDs; Milo to prepare integration test fixtures
3. **Sprint-4**: Theo to wire live settings API into Models tab; Nia to update Quickstart with admin console setup steps
4. **Cross-squad**: Record API contracts using `scripts/parallel/record_contracts.py` and store under `docs/design/contracts/2025-10-05/`
