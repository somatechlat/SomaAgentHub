# Wave Status ‚Äî 2025-10-04

Parallel execution is active with Wave A (Governance Core, Runtime & Training, Identity/Infra support) and Wave B (Experience & Ecosystem) all running simultaneously. This snapshot captures day-one status with all sprints live in parallel. See `../Parallel_Backlog.md` for task-level tracking.

## Summary
- **Overall Health:** üü° Launch-day ramp. Dependencies being provisioned; no blocking defects yet.
- **Active Sprints:** `Sprint-2 (Governance Core)`, `Sprint-3 (Runtime & Training Slice)` running concurrently.
- **Preparing:** `Sprint-4 (Experience & Ecosystem)` Design/contract intake underway for Wave B start on 2025-10-11.
- **Critical Dependencies:** Helm-managed Kafka/KRaft clusters (Infra), Redis + Postgres credentials, Temporal workflow versioning, policy header contract publishing.

## Sprint Dashboards
| Sprint | Status | Focus This Week | Key Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sprint-2 ‚Äì Governance Core | üü° In Progress | Finalize policy rule packs, wire Redis constitution cache, publish signed constitution bundle for integration day | Kafka topic provisioning lag; Redis cache warms may slip without Infra support |
| Sprint-3 ‚Äì Runtime & Training | üü° In Progress | Stand up orchestrator streaming path, train mode controller, capture API recordings for UI | Policy header contract drift; SSE/WebSocket backpressure tuning |
| Sprint-4 ‚Äì Experience & Ecosystem | ÔøΩ In Progress | Consume recorded contracts, finalize component specs, align with Identity for auth flows | Waiting on streaming contract captures; estimator data availability |

## Integration Day Checklist (Oct 8)
- [ ] `POST /v1/sessions/start` flow validated end-to-end with live policy headers and SLM queue traffic.
- [ ] Orchestrator streaming demo exercises `conversation.events` Kafka topic and training mode toggles.
- [ ] Infra delivers Helm notes + Grafana dashboards per squad.

## Blockers & Dependencies
- **Helm Kafka rollout:** Infra & Ops executing; required before constitution and policy events can land.
- **Redis caching topology:** Shared namespace definitions pending final confirmation to avoid key collisions.
- **Temporal ID broadcast:** Policy squad to publish MAO workflow version bump before Friday chaos drill.

## Next Steps
1. Sprint-2: Publish constitution signature bundle + policy header contract to `docs/design/contracts/2025-10-04/`.
2. Sprint-3: Record `/v1/chat/stream` and training mode API interactions using `scripts/parallel/record_contracts.py`.
3. Sprint-4: Align with Identity squad on capability taxonomy and prepare admin console data mocks captured from staging.
4. Infra & Ops: Automate nightly benchmark/notification pipeline and attach dashboards to SomaSuite.
