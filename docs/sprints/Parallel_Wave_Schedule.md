# Parallel Wave Schedule ‚Äî Weeks 1‚Äì6 (Extended to Wave C)

This schedule operationalizes the [Parallel Sprint Execution Playbook](Parallel_Sprint_Execution.md) by mapping roadmap backlog to squad charters and overlapping waves. Wave dates align to the current rapid development window starting **2025-10-04**.

## Timeline Overview
- **Design Wave (Week 0 & continuously +1 sprint)**: Design leads finalize specs one sprint ahead.
- **Wave A (Weeks 1‚Äì2: 2025-10-04 ‚Üí 2025-10-18)**: Memory & Constitution, SLM Execution, Policy & Orchestration, Identity & Settings, Infra & Ops. ‚úÖ Active.
- **Wave B (Weeks 2‚Äì3: 2025-10-11 ‚Üí 2025-10-25 overlap)**: UI & Experience joins with Integration focus while backend squads prep Wave C. ‚úÖ Active.
- **Wave C (Weeks 3‚Äì6: 2025-10-18 ‚Üí 2025-11-15)**: KAMACHIQ Foundation, Production Hardening, Marketplace & Analytics. üü® Launching Oct 18.

Integration Day occurs every Wednesday across all waves; staging runs only real services (Redis, Kafka/KRaft via Helm, Postgres, Temporal, SomaBrain, ClickHouse, Vault). No mocks.

## Wave Commitments

| Squad | Charter | Wave A/B Focus (Sprints 2-4) | Wave C Focus (Sprints 5-7) | Parallel Signals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Memory & Constitution | [Charter](squads/memory_constitution.md) | Sprint-2 (Constitution sync, policy engine) | Sprint-5 support (Constitution constraints for KAMACHIQ) | Follow `Parallel_Backlog.md` for status |
| SLM Execution | [Charter](squads/slm_execution.md) | Sprint-2-3 (Kafka queue, providers, runtime) | Sprint-5 (Project planning, quality gates), Sprint-6 (Load testing) | Alerting and scoring thresholds tracked |
| Policy & Orchestration | [Charter](squads/policy_orchestration.md) | Sprint-2-3 (Governance, workflows) | **Sprint-5 Lead** (Temporal, KAMACHIQ orchestration) | Temporal workflow versions tracked centrally |
| Identity & Settings | [Charter](squads/identity_settings.md) | Sprint-2 (Identity, billing, settings) | Sprint-6 support (Vault integration, mTLS) | Capability taxonomy cross-posted |
| Infra & Ops | [Charter](squads/infra_ops.md) | Sprint-2-4 (Infrastructure rollout) | **Sprint-6 Lead** (Observability, chaos, CI/CD, production deploy) | Nightly pipelines + chaos drills logged |
| UI & Experience | [Charter](squads/ui_experience.md) | Sprint-4 (Admin console, marketplace UI) | **Sprint-7 Lead** (Marketplace frontend, dashboards) | Consuming contracts + accessibility criteria |
| Analytics Service | New for Wave C | N/A | **Sprint-7 Co-Lead** (Analytics pipeline, ClickHouse, dashboards) | Event ingestion metrics tracked |
| Security Guild | Cross-squad | Sprint-2 support (Governance runbook) | Sprint-6 (Vault, mTLS, audit, scanning) | Security controls matrix updated |

## Critical Dependencies
- **Kafka Availability**: Delivered via Helm-managed KRaft cluster (`infra/helm/`); docker-compose stack is deprecated.
- **Redis / Postgres**: Managed by Infra & Ops; credentials rotated alongside identity keys.
- **Temporal**: Required for KAMACHIQ workflows (Sprint-5); Infra & Ops deploys by Oct 18.
- **ClickHouse**: Required for analytics pipeline (Sprint-7); Infra & Ops deploys by Oct 25.
- **Vault**: Required for security hardening (Sprint-6); deployed by Oct 20.
- **Telemetry Stack**: SomaSuite dashboards must ingest metrics from every squad before sprint exit.

## Cross-Squad Milestones

### Wave A/B (Weeks 1-3)
1. **Week 1 Day 3** ‚Äì Kafka topics provisioned; policy evaluation hitting real constitution hash; SLM queue processing sample traffic.
2. **Week 1 Day 5** ‚Äì Integration day dry-run: session start flow (Gateway ‚Üí Policy ‚Üí Identity ‚Üí SLM) validated end-to-end.
3. **Week 2 Day 3** ‚Äì Replay drill executed; MAO workflow version deployed; dashboards live.
4. **Week 2 Day 5** ‚Äì Wave A demo; sign-off requires production-like staging deploy + audit trail review.
5. **Week 3 Day 3** ‚Äì UI integrates live streams; nightly benchmark + regression notifications visible in Slack/SomaSuite.
6. **Week 3 Day 5** ‚Äì Wave B demo; backlog grooming for Wave C with dependency matrix update.

### Wave C (Weeks 3-6)
7. **Oct 18 (Week 3 Day 1)** ‚Äì **Wave C Launch**: Temporal cluster deployed, Observability stack live, Sprint-5/6 kickoff.
8. **Oct 21 (Week 3 Day 4)** ‚Äì First KAMACHIQ workflow executes successfully, first chaos experiment passes.
9. **Oct 25 (Week 4 Day 1)** ‚Äì **Sprint-7 Start**: ClickHouse cluster deployed, analytics ingestion begins, marketplace UI skeleton live.
10. **Oct 28 (Week 4 Day 4)** ‚Äì Load testing baseline complete, first capsule submitted to marketplace.
11. **Nov 1 (Week 5 Day 1)** ‚Äì **Sprint-5 End**: KAMACHIQ demo project completes autonomously, Temporal HA validated.
12. **Nov 8 (Week 5 Day 8)** ‚Äì **Sprint-6 End**: Production environment deployed, 7-day burn-in starts, 99.9% SLA tracking.
13. **Nov 15 (Week 6 Day 8)** ‚Äì **Sprint-7 End + Marketplace Launch**: Community capsule published, analytics dashboards live, revenue tracking functional. üéâ

## Execution Rituals
- **Daily Cross-Squad Standup (09:00 PT)**: Focus on cross-wave blockers and telemetry gaps.
- **Design & Architecture Clinic (Mon/Thu 11:00 PT)**: Review upcoming contracts, Temporal versions, UI flows.
- **Weekly Integration Day (Wed)**: Deploy to staging using Helm; run smoke tests via `pytest tests/integration`; capture metrics snapshots.
- **Chaos Drill (Fri 15:00 PT)**: Infra-led scenario rotating across squads (Week 1 Kafka outage, Week 2 Redis failover).

## Reporting & Tracking
- Unified Kanban board with swimlanes per squad; dependencies tagged `cross-squad` must have owning squad + blocking squad noted.
- `scripts/parallel/squad_status.py` runs nightly to update SomaSuite dash and publish JSON into `docs/sprints/status/<date>.json` (to be automated).
- Weekly executive summary stored in `docs/sprints/status/README.md` (to be created) capturing accomplishments, risks, mitigations.

## Next Implementation Steps
1. **DONE** ‚Äì Squad charters instantiated under `docs/sprints/squads/`.
2. **DONE** ‚Äì Parallel backlog created at `Parallel_Backlog.md` consolidating multi-sprint execution.
3. **IN-PROGRESS** ‚Äì Nightly benchmark + regression automation wiring (Infra + SLM).
4. **TODO** ‚Äì Create `docs/sprints/status/` pipeline to persist weekly reports and dashboards (assign Infra & Ops).
