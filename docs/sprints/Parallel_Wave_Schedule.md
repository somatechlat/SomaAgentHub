# Parallel Wave Schedule — Weeks 1–4

This schedule operationalizes the [Parallel Sprint Execution Playbook](Parallel_Sprint_Execution.md) by mapping roadmap backlog to squad charters and overlapping waves. Wave dates align to the current rapid development window starting **2025-10-04**.

-## Timeline Overview
- **Design Wave (Week 0 & continuously +1 sprint)**: Design leads finalize specs one sprint ahead.
- **Wave A (Weeks 1–2: 2025-10-04 → 2025-10-18)**: Memory & Constitution, SLM Execution, Policy & Orchestration, Identity & Settings, Infra & Ops. ✅ Active.
- **Wave B (Weeks 2–3: 2025-10-11 → 2025-10-25 overlap)**: UI & Experience joins with Integration focus while backend squads prep Wave C. ✅ Early start approved.
- **Wave C Preview (Weeks 3–4)**: Backlog groomed for next iteration (Marketplace/Automation) based on Wave B outcomes.

Integration Day occurs every Wednesday across all waves; staging runs only real services (Redis, Kafka/KRaft via Helm, Postgres, Temporal, SomaBrain). No mocks.

## Wave Commitments

| Squad | Charter | Current Sprint Focus | Parallel Signals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Memory & Constitution | [Charter](squads/memory_constitution.md) | Sprint-2 deliverables (outbox dispatcher, constitution enforcement) | Follow `Parallel_Backlog.md` for status, replay benchmarks in progress |
| SLM Execution | [Charter](squads/slm_execution.md) | Sprint-2 partner (Kafka queue, provider adapters, benchmarks) | Alerting and scoring thresholds tracked via consolidated backlog |
| Policy & Orchestration | [Charter](squads/policy_orchestration.md) | Sprint-2 governance agenda | Notification escalations + Temporal contracts tracked centrally |
| Identity & Settings | [Charter](squads/identity_settings.md) | Sprint-2 identity, billing, settings versioning | Capability taxonomy + billing schema cross-posted in backlog |
| Infra & Ops | [Charter](squads/infra_ops.md) | Sprint-2 infrastructure rollout | Nightly pipelines + chaos drills logged in backlog |
| UI & Experience | [Charter](squads/ui_experience.md) | Sprint-4 Experience & Ecosystem | Consuming contracts + accessibility criteria per backlog |

## Critical Dependencies
- **Kafka Availability**: Delivered via Helm-managed KRaft cluster (`infra/helm/`); docker-compose stack is deprecated.
- **Redis / Postgres**: Managed by Infra & Ops; credentials rotated alongside identity keys.
- **Temporal**: Required for MAO workflows; version bumps announced during Design Clinic.
- **Telemetry Stack**: SomaSuite dashboards must ingest metrics from every squad before sprint exit.

## Cross-Squad Milestones
1. **Week 1 Day 3** – Kafka topics provisioned; policy evaluation hitting real constitution hash; SLM queue processing sample traffic.
2. **Week 1 Day 5** – Integration day dry-run: session start flow (Gateway → Policy → Identity → SLM) validated end-to-end.
3. **Week 2 Day 3** – Replay drill executed; MAO workflow version deployed; dashboards live.
4. **Week 2 Day 5** – Wave A demo; sign-off requires production-like staging deploy + audit trail review.
5. **Week 3 Day 3** – UI integrates live streams; nightly benchmark + regression notifications visible in Slack/SomaSuite.
6. **Week 3 Day 5** – Wave B demo; backlog grooming for Wave C with dependency matrix update.

## Execution Rituals
- **Daily Cross-Squad Standup (09:00 PT)**: Focus on cross-wave blockers and telemetry gaps.
- **Design & Architecture Clinic (Mon/Thu 11:00 PT)**: Review upcoming contracts, Temporal versions, UI flows.
- **Weekly Integration Day (Wed)**: Deploy to staging using Helm; run smoke tests via `pytest tests/integration`; capture metrics snapshots.
- **Chaos Drill (Fri 15:00 PT)**: Infra-led scenario rotating across squads (Week 1 Kafka outage, Week 2 Redis failover).

## Reporting & Tracking
- Unified Kanban board with swimlanes per squad; dependencies tagged `cross-squad` must have owning squad + blocking squad noted.
- `scripts/parallel/squad_status.py` runs nightly to update SomaSuite dash and publish JSON into `docs/sprints/status/<date>.json` (to be automated).
- Weekly executive summary stored in `docs/sprints/status/README.md` (to be created) capturing accomplishments, risks, mitigations.

## Next Implementation Steps
1. **DONE** – Squad charters instantiated under `docs/sprints/squads/`.
2. **DONE** – Parallel backlog created at `Parallel_Backlog.md` consolidating multi-sprint execution.
3. **IN-PROGRESS** – Nightly benchmark + regression automation wiring (Infra + SLM).
4. **TODO** – Create `docs/sprints/status/` pipeline to persist weekly reports and dashboards (assign Infra & Ops).
