## Cross-Squad Dependencies (Live)
- **Wave A/B**: Kafka topics: `constitution.updated`, `policy.decisions`, `identity.audit`, `conversation.events`, `training.audit`, `slm.metrics`, `marketplace.catalog` — provisioned by Infra & Ops.
- **Wave C New**: Temporal cluster (Sprint-5), ClickHouse (Sprint-7), MinIO/S3 (Sprint-7), Vault (Sprint-6), Litmus Chaos (Sprint-6)
- Redis namespaces: shared key strategy published by Identity squad; Training + Policy caches reuse this layout.
- Temporal workflow version: MAO version bump announced by Policy & Orchestration to Runtime squad before Integration Day.
- Recorded contracts: Runtime squad to capture `/v1/chat/stream`, Governance to capture `/v1/evaluate`, both delivered to Experience squad before 2025-10-09.
- **Sprint-5 → Sprint-6**: Production Temporal deployment requires HA configuration from Sprint-6
- **Sprint-5 → Sprint-7**: KAMACHIQ execution engine needed for capsule execution workflows
- **Sprint-6 → Sprint-7**: Observability stack required for analytics pipeline and marketplace metrics

## Daily Tracking
- Update statuses during 09:00 PT stand-up; shift tasks to 🟧 or 🟩 as teams progress.
