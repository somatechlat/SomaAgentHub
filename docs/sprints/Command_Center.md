# Parallel Sprint Command Center

This guide keeps Sprint-2 (Governance Core), Sprint-3 (Runtime & Training), and Sprint-4 (Experience & Ecosystem) advancing simultaneously while honoring the "real systems only" mandate.

## Daily Operating Rhythm
- **08:30 PT — Infra Pulse (15 min)**
  - Infra & Ops confirms Kafka/Redis/Postgres availability, reviews SomaSuite dashboard alerts, and shares planned maintenance.
- **09:00 PT — Cross-Squad Standup (15 min)**
  - Each squad reports status, blockers, telemetry gaps.
  - Update `Parallel_Backlog.md` statuses live; escalate cross-squad blockers tagged `cross-squad`.
- **11:00 PT — Design & Contract Clinic (Mon/Thu)**
  - Review upcoming API/Temporal/streaming contracts; Experience squad confirms intake readiness.
- **16:00 PT — Async Wrap (Slack update)**
  - Squad leads post daily summary with metrics snapshots, contract updates, and upcoming hand-offs.

## Integration Day (Wednesday) Checklist
1. Deploy via Helm to staging (Infra lead).
2. Run smoke suite:
   - `pytest tests/integration/policy` (Governance).
   - `pytest tests/integration/orchestrator` (Runtime).
   - `pnpm test --filter admin-console` once UI wiring lands.
3. Validate Kafka topics receiving live traffic (`constitution.updated`, `policy.decisions`, `conversation.events`, `training.audit`).
4. Capture metrics screenshots for dashboards; archive under `docs/sprints/status/<date>/evidence/`.

## Dashboards & Telemetry
- **SomaSuite Panels** (Infra managed):
  - `Governance Core` — policy latency, constitution sync freshness.
  - `Runtime & Training` — streaming latency, training mode state, Kafka lag.
  - `Experience` — WebVitals, API latency, websocket throughput.
- **Alert Routing**
  - Use Pager rotation with reliability anchors; incidents open a Tiger Crew bridge.
  - All alerts include `trace_id` links for OTel traces.

## Contract Recording Workflow
1. Runtime squad runs `scripts/parallel/record_contracts.py` with staging endpoints.
2. Publish contracts under `docs/design/contracts/<yyyy-mm-dd>/` with README describing schema.
3. Experience squad imports recordings into Storybook & Playwright fixtures.
4. Governance squad records policy headers + constitution bundle signatures alongside runbook references.

## Status Artifacts
- `Parallel_Backlog.md` — live execution grid.
- `status/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — daily/weekly executive summary (update minimum twice per week).
- `Parallel_Wave_Schedule.md` — cadence + dependency map (refresh at sprint milestones).
- `Command_Center.md` — this operational handbook.

## Escalation Protocol
- Blocker >4h? Tag `#tiger-crew` in Slack with summary, owner, ETA for next update.
- Kafka/Redis outages trigger runbooks in `docs/runbooks/` (kill-switch, disaster recovery).
- Design drift detected? Schedule ad-hoc clinic and block dependent work until contract merged.

## Exit Criteria for Parallel Cycle
- All three sprints meet acceptance criteria with real staging deployments.
- Telemetry dashboards updated and linked in status report.
- Documentation (Quickstart, runbooks, design contracts) reflects shipped features.
- Backlog completed/rolled forward with explicit owners.
