# Sprint Wave 4: SomaBrain Experience Marketplace

**Window:** October 6 ‚Äì November 3, 2025 (4 parallel sprints, two-week cadence)  
**Context:** Extends `docs/CANONICAL_ROADMAP.md` (Wave 4) and leverages `docs/SomaBrain_Canonical_Mathematics.md`, SomaFractal Memory, and the existing Marketplace backend to publish/rent expert personas.

## üéØ Strategic Goals
- Turn SomaBrain-trained personas + model boxes into portable "experience capsules" with verified manifests.
- Enable customers to purchase, subscribe to, or time-rent personas via Marketplace while enforcing constitutional guarantees.
- Amplify SomaBrain cognition (geodesic retrieval, bridge planning, FRGO transport) to remove historical memory limits.
- Provide production-grade governance: audit trails, pricing telemetry, moderation automation, legal alignment.

## üß≠ Sprint Overview

| Sprint | Focus | Primary Outputs | Leads |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Œ©-A | SomaBrain Memory Amplification | Enhanced retrieval math, FRGO transport, density diagnostics | Memory Platform + ML Ops |
| Œ©-B | Persona Capsule Packaging | Manifest schema, export/import pipeline, evaluation harness, CLI | Orchestrator + DevEx |
| Œ©-C | Marketplace Commerce & Rentals | Marketplace endpoints, billing hooks, rental orchestration, discovery UX | Marketplace + Billing |
| Œ©-D | Governance, Trust & Operations | Manifest signing, policy enforcement, dashboards, moderation runbooks | Security + Platform Ops |

Each sprint runs concurrently with shared daily syncs (09:00 UTC) and cross-track design reviews twice per week. Unlimited engineering capacity lets us staff every sprint with dedicated squads.

## Sprint Œ©-A ‚Äî SomaBrain Memory Amplification

**Intent:** Implement the advanced mathematics described in `SomaBrain_Canonical_Mathematics.md` to increase context fidelity and eliminate recall limits.

### Objectives
- Ship geodesic similarity + bridge planning (`somabrain/memory_client.py`, `transport/bridge.py`).
- Activate FRGO transport learning with guardrails (`transport/flow_opt.py`).
- Finalize density-matrix cleanup + anomaly dashboards.
- Expand property-based tests + SPC monitors for retrieval accuracy.

### Deliverables
- ‚úÖ `somabrain/memory_client.py`: geodesic retrieval toggle with fallbacks.
- ‚úÖ `transport/bridge.py`: heat-kernel bridge planner + Sinkhorn scaling tests.
- ‚úÖ `transport/flow_opt.py`: FRGO conductance updates with clip safeguards.
- ‚úÖ Grafana panels: Memory Cohesion, Geodesic Recall, Density Health.
- ‚úÖ Prometheus alerts: `memory_geodesic_anomaly`, `density_matrix_divergence`.

### Acceptance Criteria
- p95 recall latency < 600ms with new math enabled.
- ‚â•10% improvement in retrieval accuracy on benchmark suite.
- Zero regression in utility guard pass rate.

### Dependencies
- Qdrant vector store online (existing).
- Analytics service for SPC chart baselines.

## Sprint Œ©-B ‚Äî Persona Capsule Packaging

**Intent:** Convert training-mode output into distributable, verifiable persona capsules.

### Objectives
- Define `capsules/persona_manifest.yaml` schema (model box ref, memory bundle, tool ACLs, constitution hash).
- Build export/import service (FastAPI worker + MinIO storage) triggered from training mode.
- Attach evaluation harness referencing reward gating invariants (`somabrain/learning/adaptation.py`).
- Provide DevEx CLI `soma persona publish` with end-to-end integrity checks.

### Deliverables
- ‚úÖ Manifest schema + JSONSchema validators.
- ‚úÖ Export worker in `services/orchestrator/app/persona_exporter.py`.
- ‚úÖ CLI commands under `cli/soma/persona/` for publish, verify, import.
- ‚úÖ Automated evaluation report stored alongside capsule artifact.
- ‚úÖ Documentation + examples `docs/examples/persona_capsules/`.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Capsule export completes < 5 minutes for 10k-memory persona.
- Import validation rejects tampered manifests (checksum mismatch).
- Evaluation harness produces reproducible scores within ¬±2% variance.

### Dependencies
- Training mode Redis locks + audit events.
- MinIO S3 storage configured (Sprint A output).

## Sprint Œ©-C ‚Äî Marketplace Commerce & Rentals

**Intent:** Monetize personas/model boxes with purchase, subscription, and rental options.

### Objectives
- Extend Marketplace API with persona/catalog endpoints (`services/marketplace-service/app.py`).
- Integrate billing telemetry (token estimator + ClickHouse) to compute usage charges.
- Implement rental orchestration via Orchestrator + Temporal timers.
- Surface discovery UI schema for Admin Console + CLI.

### Deliverables
- ‚úÖ REST endpoints: `/v1/personas`, `/v1/personas/{id}/rent`, `/v1/personas/{id}/activate`.
- ‚úÖ Billing hooks emitting `marketplace.billing` Kafka events.
- ‚úÖ Rental workflow in `services/orchestrator/app/workflows/rental_workflow.py` with auto off-boarding.
- ‚úÖ Admin Console tiles + CLI `soma marketplace list-personas`.
- ‚úÖ Pricing calculator + quota enforcement integrated with cost dashboards.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Rentals enforce time limits with ¬±30s precision.
- Billing report reconciles with ClickHouse ledger nightly.
- Marketplace search returns persona within 200ms.

### Dependencies
- Persona manifests from Sprint Œ©-B.
- Token estimator analytics service.

## Sprint Œ©-D ‚Äî Governance, Trust & Operations

**Intent:** Guarantee constitutional, legal, and operational safety for shared experiences.

### Objectives
- Implement Ed25519 + threshold manifest signing pipeline (`services/common/crypto`).
- Add training-mode approval queue w/ OPA checks and Identity enforcement.
- Automate moderation (capsule scanning, tool ACL review) before publication.
- Extend observability (Grafana + Prometheus) and legal documentation.

### Deliverables
- ‚úÖ Signature service (`services/constitution/signing_service.py`) with t-of-n support.
- ‚úÖ Approval UI/API (`services/admin-console`) for persona publication.
- ‚úÖ OPA policies for export/import & rental, plus regression test suite.
- ‚úÖ Grafana dashboard: Marketplace Trust & Rentals; alerts for policy breaches.
- ‚úÖ Updated legal docs (`docs/legal/SomaGent_Default_Terms.md`) and new runbook `docs/runbooks/marketplace_operations.md`.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Every published capsule carries verified multi-signer manifest.
- Audit trail covers 100% of exports/imports with immutable SHA3-512 IDs.
- Zero critical policy violations in staging load tests.

### Dependencies
- Marketplace events (Œ©-C) and persona artifacts (Œ©-B).
- Constitution artifacts + OPA policy repo.

## üóÇÔ∏è Cross-Track Coordination
- **Daily Sync:** 09:00 UTC (Marketplace + SomaBrain leads).
- **Design Reviews:** Tuesdays & Thursdays, 16:00 UTC.
- **Release Train:** Weekly integration demo every Friday (choose persona, rent, observe metrics).
- **Documentation:** Living updates in `docs/` + runbooks; marketing collateral tracked in Plane board `EXPERIENCE-MARKETPLACE`.

## üöÄ Day 0 Kick-off Checklist
1. Finalize engineering allocations per sprint squad (unlimited capacity available).
2. Spin up dedicated staging environment `wave4-marketplace` with cloned data.
3. Publish baseline evaluation suite + datasets for persona benchmarking.
4. Announce initiative roadmap to stakeholders (internal broadcast + partner briefing).

## üìä Metrics & Reporting
- Utility uplift (`soma_utility_value`) vs. baseline.
- Persona rental revenue, conversion, renewal rates.
- Memory recall accuracy, anomaly counts, density stability.
- Governance metrics: approval SLA, policy violations, signature latency.

## üìå Risk Register
- **Data leakage:** Mitigate with manifest signing, OPA policies, encryption at rest.
- **Billing drift:** Real-time reconciliation + threshold alerts.
- **Model/provider outages:** Multi-model fallback via SLM catalog; Marketplace indicates degraded modes.
- **Persona IP disputes:** Legal workflow + revocation procedures in new runbook.

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done (Wave 4)
- All four sprints deliver GA-ready features with passing regression/e2e suites.
- Marketplace supports persona purchase + rentals with complete billing + governance flows.
- SomaBrain retrieval math enhancements enabled in production with observability + rollback plan.
- Updated documentation, legal terms, and marketing assets published.
