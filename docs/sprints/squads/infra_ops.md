# Squad Charter — Infrastructure & Operations

## Mission
Provide production-equivalent environments (local, staging, prod) with observability, security, and automation so every squad ships against real systems continuously.

## Wave Alignment
- **Wave A (Weeks 1–2)** — Helm rollout, Kafka/Postgres/Redis readiness, chaos drill scaffolding.
- **Wave B (Weeks 2–3)** — Supports Experience squad integrations and maintains nightly benchmark + regression automation.

## Wave A Deliverables
- [ ] Deploy Helm overlays for staging with real Kafka/KRaft, Postgres, Redis, SomaBrain components and publish configs in `infra/helm/`.
- [ ] Provision Kafka topics for all squads (`slm.requests`, `slm.responses`, `policy.decisions`, `identity.audit`, `settings.changed`, `constitution.updated`, `billing.events`).
- [ ] Enable SomaSuite dashboards per squad using `scripts/parallel/squad_status.py` data source.
- [ ] Execute weekly chaos drill (focus on Kafka outage) with report stored in `docs/runbooks/disaster_recovery.md`.

### Dependencies
- Access to Kubernetes cluster (staging) and Terraform cloud for overlays.
- Collaboration with Memory/SLM squads for topic schemas.
- Observability exporters integrated by service owners.

## Wave B Preparations (Ready by Wave A Demo)
- [ ] Nightly benchmark + regression pipelines wired to notification feed tagged per squad.
- [ ] Secrets rotation schedule documented and aligned with Identity squad.
- [ ] Capacity benchmarks (Kafka lag, Redis ops/sec, Postgres TPS) captured and published to dashboards.

## Telemetry & Quality Gates
- Build + deploy automation triggers on each merge; failures block release.
- Chaos drills must include recovery time metrics ≤ target RTO.
- Integration day smoke tests green across all services.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Kafka unavailability locally → Mitigate by documenting Helm-based provisioning and deprecating docker-compose stack; ensure developers use staging or local KRaft cluster scripts.
- **Risk:** Dashboard drift → Mitigate via automated export of Grafana configs checked into repo weekly.
