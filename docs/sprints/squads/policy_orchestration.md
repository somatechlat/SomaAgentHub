# Squad Charter — Policy & Orchestration

## Mission
Guarantee every session and tool action is constitutionally sound by pairing a deterministic Policy Engine with resilient gateway + Temporal orchestration.

## Wave Alignment
- **Wave A (Weeks 1–2)** — Governance Core sprint delivering policy scorecards and MAO workflow upgrades.
- **Wave B (Weeks 2–3)** — Experience & Infra integration consuming new enforcement headers and orchestration telemetry.

## Wave A Deliverables
- [ ] Harden `/v1/evaluate` implementation with pydantic rule packs, Redis caching, and deterministic scoring under 15 ms p95.
- [ ] Propagate constitution hash and policy decision headers (`X-Policy-Decision`, `X-Constitution-Hash`) through Gateway and Orchestrator.
- [ ] Publish MAO workflow version bump with Temporal changelog recorded in `docs/design/contracts/temporal/`.
- [ ] Emit audit trail to Kafka `policy.decisions` with schema docs.

### Dependencies
- Constitution service Redis cache maintained by Memory squad.
- Identity service JWT signer embedding constitution hash.
- Temporal cluster provisioned by Infra squad.

## Wave B Preparations (Ready by Wave A Demo)
- [ ] Notification escalation flows designed with Experience squad (`docs/design/wave-2/notification_escalations.md`).
- [ ] Temporal contract updates reviewed by Infra and Settings squads.
- [ ] Load test scenarios for policy evaluation captured in `tests/perf/policy_eval/` with real data.

## Telemetry & Quality Gates
- Metrics: `policy_decision_total{tenant,decision}`, `policy_eval_latency_ms` histogram, Temporal workflow success ratio.
- Integration tests spanning Gateway → Policy → Orchestrator executed nightly in staging.
- Production readiness requires runbook update in `docs/runbooks/kill_switch.md` reflecting new policy hooks.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Workflow version drift across services → Mitigate with pinned IDs in settings-service and integration day validation.
- **Risk:** Policy latency regression → Mitigate with redis warmers and circuit breaker that rejects outliers with safe refusal.
