# Sprint 2 — Governance Core

Goal: Ship the first production-ready governance chain so every request is constitutionally verified and policy decisions are cached for low-latency enforcement.

Top-level acceptance criteria:
- Policy Engine service exposes `/v1/evaluate` implementing deterministic scoring with constitution-backed rule sets, returning `decision`, `score`, and `reasons` within 15 ms p95.
- Constitution Service synchronizes signed constitutions from SomaBrain every 5 minutes, caches current hash in Redis, and exposes `/v1/constitution` read APIs.
- Identity Service issues scoped access tokens via `/v1/tokens/issue`, storing key material in KMS-backed secrets with rotation hooks.
- Gateway API enforces incoming requests to include policy decision headers; denies requests when evaluation fails.

Tasks
- [ ] Finalize policy rule model (pydantic schema, scoring math) and implement deterministic evaluator with unit tests.
- [ ] Integrate Redis caching layer for constitution hashes, including background refresh worker and Prometheus gauges.
- [ ] Implement Identity Service token issuance, rotation scheduler, and audit logging to Kafka `identity.audit` topic.
- [ ] Update Gateway middleware to call Policy Engine, pass identity context, and propagate enforcement headers.
- [ ] Add integration test: `POST /v1/sessions/start` -> policy evaluate -> decision enforced -> token minted.
- [ ] Document governance runbook updates in `docs/runbooks/security.md`.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Policy Engine Hardening**
	- Replace the in-memory rule dataclasses with a Pydantic-backed rule pack loader that persists canonical rule definitions per tenant in Redis.
	- Implement deterministic scoring by clamping aggregate weights, persist cached verdict snapshots, and emit `policy_decision_total{tenant,decision}` plus latency histograms that meet the 15 ms p95 target.
	- Run an async background task that prefetches the current constitution hash and listens for Kafka `constitution.updated` events with exponential backoff to keep the cache warm.

2. **Constitution Synchronization**
	- Stand up a lifecycle task that refreshes the signed bundle from SomaBrain every 5 minutes, verifies signatures, and updates both Redis keys `constitution:{tenant}` and in-memory registry.
	- Export Prometheus gauges for last sync timestamp and bundle version, and add tests that exercise the refresh path with a fake SomaBrain endpoint.

3. **Identity Service Enhancements**
	- Introduce a KMS-backed signer abstraction (file-based fallback locally) with rotation metadata stored in Redis, scheduled rotation hooks, and audit proof of issuance.
	- Embed the active constitution hash inside every JWT claim set, persist token issuance events to Kafka `identity.audit`, and expand tests for rotation, verify, and revoke workflows.

4. **Gateway Enforcement**
	- Replace the stub FastAPI application with the full router, calling `/v1/evaluate` before forwarding, and propagate policy decision headers (`X-Policy-Decision`, `X-Policy-Score`, `X-Constitution-Hash`).
	- Record moderation + policy latency metrics, and reject requests that fail identity verification or policy evaluation determinism checks.

5. **Integration & Runbook Updates**
	- Add a governance integration test that drives identity issuance, gateway session creation, policy evaluation, and header enforcement using fakeredis/aiokafka fixtures.
	- Update `docs/runbooks/security.md` with rotation cadence, Kafka topic ownership, and operational rollback guidance.

Notes
- Coordinate with Security guild for secret rotation cadence.
- Reuse existing Prometheus registry; emit `policy_decision_total` counter with `decision`, `policy_id` labels.
- Ensure identity tokens embed constitution hash to detect drift.
