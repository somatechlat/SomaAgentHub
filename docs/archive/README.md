## üìñ How to Use This Archive

### If you need Phase implementation details:

1. Start with the main **Technical Manual** (`docs/technical-manual/`)
2. Check specific sections (e.g., `deployment.md`, `security/`)
3. Refer to archived PHASE documents for implementation context

### If you need historical context:

Read **ROADMAP-2.5-COMPLETE.md** for the original vision and complete implementation summary.

### If you're auditing the project:

All Phase implementations are verified in:
- Kubernetes manifests: `k8s/`
- Infrastructure configs: `infra/`
- Implementation scripts: `scripts/`
- Service code: `services/`
