# Executive Summary

Generated: October 2025

This repository implements a pragmatic multi-agent orchestration platform with Temporal workflows, FastAPI services, and a lean observability setup based on Prometheus (metrics) and Loki (logs). It also includes an Airflow service for batch jobs and a scaffold for Apache Flink streaming.

Key facts (current state):

- Observability
   - Prometheus deployed with Grafana disabled; ServiceMonitors scrape Gateway and Orchestrator
   - Loki deployed; services can attach a Loki logging handler via LOKI_URL
   - No Grafana dashboards are required for operation; use Prometheus/Loki endpoints or your own tools
- Services
   - Gateway API and Orchestrator run locally or in Kubernetes
   - Orchestrator analytics activity emits a real Prometheus Counter with label hints for querying
- Batch/Stream
   - Airflow: example DAG that calls the Gateway, configured to log to Loki
   - Flink: job skeleton and manifests for future streaming work
- Tooling
   - Scripts install Prometheus (Grafana disabled) and apply Loki
   - Tests include a unit test validating analytics activity output

Whatâ€™s not claimed:

- No promise of 100% production readiness; this repo favors working, verifiable integrations over aspirational features
- No Grafana dashboards or Tempo traces are assumed; only Prometheus+Loki are baseline

Next steps (suggested):

- Documentation alignment across all docs with the current stack (in progress)
- Optional: cluster-wide log shipping to Loki via Fluent Bit DaemonSet
- Optional: expose Airflow metrics and add a ServiceMonitor
