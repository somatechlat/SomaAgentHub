# SomaAgentHub

SomaAgentHub is a multi-agent orchestration platform centered on Temporal workflows, FastAPI services, and a pragmatic observability stack built on Prometheus (metrics) and Loki (logs). It includes batch scheduling with Airflow and a scaffold for stream processing with Apache Flink.

This README reflects the current state of the repository and avoids unimplemented claims. Grafana is not required; metrics and logs can be queried directly via Prometheus and Loki endpoints or your preferred tooling.

## Components

- Services
  - Gateway API: FastAPI gateway for external clients
  - Orchestrator: Temporal-based workflow orchestration and activities
- Observability
  - Prometheus: pulls /metrics from services
  - Loki: central log aggregation via optional per-service handler
- Batch/Stream
  - Airflow: DAGs for operational tasks (e.g., memory refresh)
  - Flink: scaffold for future streaming jobs

## What‚Äôs implemented now

- Orchestrator analytics emits a real Prometheus Counter during the marketing workflow analytics setup activity.
- Optional Loki logging handler in gateway and orchestrator when LOKI_URL is set.
- Airflow service with a working DAG that calls the Gateway; Airflow logs to Loki.
- Kubernetes manifests for Prometheus ServiceMonitors, Loki, Airflow; hardened Deployments with probes/resources.
- Scripts to deploy Prometheus (Grafana disabled) and Loki, and to verify instrumentation.
- Unit test covering analytics activity outputs and hints.

See docs/observability/README.md for deploy and verification steps.

## Quick start (local, minimal)

Prereqs: Python 3.10+, pip, uvicorn (dev), and optionally Docker/Kubernetes for full stack.

1) Install dev dependencies

  - pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

2) Run services locally (example)

  - Gateway: uvicorn services/gateway-api/app.main:app --reload --port 60000
  - Orchestrator: uvicorn services/orchestrator/app.main:app --reload --port 60002

3) Check metrics

  - curl http://localhost:60000/metrics | head -n 20

## Kubernetes deployment (Prometheus+Loki)

- Prometheus: installed with Grafana disabled in scripts/deploy.sh
- Loki: k8s/loki-deployment.yaml manifest
- ServiceMonitors: k8s/monitoring/servicemonitors.yaml (targets gateway/orchestrator namespaces including somaagent)

Run scripts/deploy.sh to set up Prometheus and Loki, then follow docs/observability/README.md for port-forwards and verification.

## Airflow

- Service at services/airflow-service with Dockerfile, Loki logging config, and example DAG calling the Gateway.
- Kubernetes manifests under k8s for Airflow webserver/scheduler; set LOKI_URL and GATEWAY_URL via env.

## Flink (scaffold)

- services/flink-job contains a starter job and containerization bits; manifests provided for a basic deployment.

## Development notes

- Unit tests live under tests/; run with pytest.
- When adding services, expose /metrics and label the Service with monitoring: enabled to be scraped by Prometheus.
- To enable Loki logging in a service, set LOKI_URL (http://loki:3100) and ensure python-logging-loki is installed in that image or environment.

## Status and next steps

- Docs are being updated to align with this stack. For observability, start with docs/observability/README.md.
- Optional: add cluster-wide log shipping (Fluent Bit DaemonSet) into Loki.

# üöÄ SomaAgentHub - RAPID SPRINT EXECUTION READY

## ‚ö° **CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED - READY FOR SPRINT WAVES**

All critical infrastructure issues have been resolved. The project is now in **RAPID DEVELOPMENT MODE** with multi-sprint parallel execution capability.

---

## üéØ **QUICK START**

### **Option 1: Full Rapid Sprint (Recommended)**
```bash
# Execute complete sprint wave with parallel tasks
./scripts/rapid-sprint.sh
```

### **Option 2: Step-by-Step Development** 
```bash
# 1. Build and deploy services
./scripts/dev-deploy.sh

# 2. Validate deployment
./scripts/integration-test.sh

# 3. Build custom images (optional)
./scripts/build_and_push.sh
```

### **Option 3: Manual Kubernetes Deployment**
```bash
# Apply namespace
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml

# Deploy with Helm
helm upgrade --install soma-agent-hub ./k8s/helm/soma-agent-hub \
  --namespace soma-agent-hub --create-namespace
```
