# SomaAgentHub

SomaAgentHub is the autonomy control tower for organizations that demand production-grade AI orchestration, business-grade guardrails, and human-readable accountability. This single file explains the platform in plain language, surfacing every module, value proposition, and competitive advantage so product teams, operators, and agents all know what SomaAgentHub delivers.

> **Promise:** Go from "What if an agent could run this?" to "It shipped in production" without sacrificing compliance, observability, or human oversight.

- **Differentiator:** Every integration, policy, and runbook is live, tested, and backed by real infrastructure—no demo shortcuts.

## How SomaAgentHub Creates Value
```
Customer Goal --> Wizard Intake --> Policy & Constitution Check --> Orchestrated Execution
       |             |                      |                           |
       v             v                      v                           v

       `-------- Continuous Memory & Analytics Feedback Loop -----------'
```

### The Flywheel Explained
1. **Intent Intake** – Wizards capture business goals, reference existing personas, and assemble draft automations.
2. **Guardrail Approval** – Constitution service and OPA policies validate every step for tenant, region, and compliance rules.
3. **Autonomous Execution** – Orchestrator coordinates agents, deterministic services, and human approvals in real time.
4. **Memory & Insight** – Results feed the Qdrant/Redis memory lattice and ClickHouse analytics for smarter future decisions.
5. **Continuous Optimization** – Analytics and evolution engines recommend improvements, spawn experiments, and update capsules.

## Platform Pillars
| Pillar | What It Means | Why Customers Care |
|--------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Autonomous Orchestration** | Task graphs blend deterministic services, LLM agents, and human approvals. | Run mission-critical workflows end-to-end with confidence. |
| **Constitutional Governance** | Tenant-specific constitutions, OPA policies, and kill-switches. | Stay compliant with regulatory, legal, and brand mandates. |
| **Real Integrations** | Adapter generator ships ready-to-run connectors for CRM, marketing, analytics, infra, and more. | Unlock value immediately instead of wiring fragile scripts. |
| **Memory Intelligence** | Qdrant vector search + Redis episodic memory + ClickHouse analytics. | Agents remember commitments, avoid duplication, and personalize experiences. |
| **Observability First** | OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Loki, and curated runbooks in every service. | Teams troubleshoot faster and prove agent ROI with hard data. |
| **Human Collaboration** | Wizards, admin console, approval workflows, and clear audit trails. | Humans stay in charge, guiding agents rather than chasing them. |

## Module-by-Module Narrative
| Module | Location | Story for Humans | Value for Agents |

| Orchestrator Core | `services/orchestrator` | Enforces deterministic execution, retries, compensation, and event tracing. | Coordinates agents with predictable state transitions. |
| Kamachiq Service | `services/kamachiq-service` | Autonomous execution mode with kill switches, approval hooks, and mission tracking. | Long-horizon autonomy without losing human oversight. |
| Constitution Service | `services/constitution-service` | Stores constitutional rules, adjudicates policy conflicts, logs history. | Gives agents clear behavioral boundaries per tenant. |
| Policy Engine | `services/policy-engine` | OPA-driven evaluations on each request with contextual data. | Real-time go/no-go checks before actions fire. |
| Tool Service | `services/tool-service` | Manages adapter lifecycle, permissions, and marketplace metadata. Ships adapters for AWS, Azure, GCP, GitHub, GitLab, Figma, Plane, Slack, Jira, Linear, Notion, Confluence, Terraform, Playwright, Discord, and Kubernetes. | Agents gain instant access to authenticated tool calls. |
| Adapter Generator | `services/tool-service/adapter-generator` | Builds adapters from live OpenAPI specs (no mocks). | Adds new tool capabilities quickly and safely. |

| Settings Service | `services/settings-service` | Feature flags, tenant defaults, rollout orchestration. | Allows staged releases and progressive capability enabling. |
| Analytics Service | `services/analytics-service` | Feeds ClickHouse with agent performance, latency, and impact metrics. | Highlights optimization opportunities and proves success. |
| Flink Streaming Job | `services/flink-service` | PyFlink pipeline that aggregates Kafka events and pushes metrics to Prometheus Pushgateway. | Keeps downstream analytics fresh with per-minute event insights. |
| Evolution Engine | `services/evolution-engine` | Tracks experiments, A/B tests, and persona training data. | Drives continuous improvement for agent behaviors. |
| Voice Interface | `services/voice-interface` | Voice pipeline and telephony integrations. | Gives agents human-grade conversational interfaces. |
| Admin Console | `apps/admin-console` | Operational dashboards, approvals, audit trails, and health views. | Gives humans instant context and control. |

## Use Cases That Win
