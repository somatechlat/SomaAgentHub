SomaGent is a multi-tenant agent platform that orchestrates real work for real teams.
These agents coordinate policy enforcement, memory retrieval, and capsule execution without mocks.
The SomaSuite observability console highlights token budgets, latency anomalies, and policy decisions.
Developers collaborate with personas, capsules, and workflows that automate delivery from planning to release.
When a session begins, the orchestrator streams directives, tool calls, and memory updates across Kafka topics.
SomaBrain preserves long-term knowledge, while the SomaFractalMemory layer accelerates semantic recall.
KAMACHIQ Mode accelerates programs by combining planners, reviewers, and tool specialists under a shared constitution.
The notification service ensures important events reach operators in real-time with zero tolerance for fake data.
Metrics, traces, and alerts are collected through Prometheus and rendered in the SomaSuite dashboards.
Every deployment honours the absolute rule: no mocking, no bypass, only truthful server side execution.
