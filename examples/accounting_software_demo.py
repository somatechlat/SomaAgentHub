This script simulates the initial phase of the "Accounting Software for Ecuador" use case.
It demonstrates:
1. Capturing the initial user request.
2. Running a simulated wizard to gather requirements.
3. Generating a structured ProjectPlan JSON file.

This output file can then be used as the input for the Multi-Agent Orchestrator.
